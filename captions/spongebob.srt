00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:16,599
Yeah! AII right!

158
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:22,549
PeopIe of Bikini Bottom,
as the manager of--

159
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,034
SpongeBob.

160
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:27,447
HoId the phone, foIks, I'm getting an
important news fIash from Mr. Krabs.

161
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,391
Go ahead, Mr. K.

162
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:32,769
I'm making a compIete what
of myseIf?

163
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:38,005
The most embarrassing thing
you've ever seen?

164
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:40,696
And now it's worse
because I'm repeating

165
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,615
everything you say
into the microphone?

166
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:46,888
Oh, for crying out Ioud, SpongeBob,
you didn't get the job.

167
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:52,226
- What?
- You did not get the job.

168
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,455
But-- But why?

169
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,788
SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook,

170
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:02,268
but I gave the job to Squidward
because being manager

171
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,656
is a big responsibiIity.

172
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,868
WeII, Iet's face it, he's more...

173
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,325
- ...mature than you.
- I'm not...

174
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:11,855
...mature?

175
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,439
Lad, I mean this
in the nicest of ways,

176
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:17,390
but there's a word for what you are,

177
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,188
and that word is...

178
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:21,140
Now, Iet's see...

179
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:24,977
- Dork?
- No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.

180
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:28,021
- A goofbaII?
- CIoser, but no, no, no.

181
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:29,750
- A ding-a-Iing.
- Wing nut.

182
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,737
A KnuckIehead McSpazatron.

183
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,579
Okay, that's enough.

184
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:37,735
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
you're just a kid.

185
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:40,703
And to be a manager,
you have to be a man.

186
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,338
Otherwise they'd caII it ''kid-ager.''

187
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:46,853
You understand-ager?
I mean, you understand?

188
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,132
I guess so, Mr. Krabs.

189
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,688
SpongeBob?

190
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,868
I'm ready. Depression.

191
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,962
I'm ready. Depression.

192
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,081
Poor kid.

193
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,298
Hooray for SpongeBob!

194
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:13,118
Hooray for SpongeBob!

195
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:19,593
Let's hear it for SpongeBob!

196
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,090
HeIIo?

197
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:23,425
Where'd everybody go?

198
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:26,246
Did I miss something?

199
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,923
Did you see my butt?

200
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:31,326
<i>Later that evening...</i>

201
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:35,907
Time to put PIan Z into effect.

202
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:41,362
Starting at the undersea castIe
of King Neptune.

203
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,367
Oh, right.

204
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,275
The royaI court is now in session.

205
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,553
Bring the prisoner forward.

206
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,176
So you have confessed to the crime
of touching the king's crown.

207
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,237
- Yes, but--
- But what?

208
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:17,234
But it's my job, Your Highness.
I'm the royaI crown poIisher.

209
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:21,730
WeII, then I guess
I can't execute you.

210
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:25,347
- Twenty years in the dungeon it is.
- Daddy.

211
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,304
You're free to go.

212
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,613
BIess you, Princess Mindy.

213
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,811
Mindy, how dare you defy me.

214
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:37,527
Why do you have to be so mean?

215
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:41,345
I am the king.
I must enforce the Iaws of the sea.

216
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:44,150
Father, I wish you'd try
a IittIe Iove and compassion

217
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:45,948
instead of these harsh punishments.

218
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,972
That wouId be nice.

219
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,141
Squire, cIear the room.

220
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,230
I wish to speak
to my daughter aIone.

221
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,142
What is this, Mindy?

222
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:59,396
- Your crown?
- And what does this crown do?

223
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,122
- Covers your baId spot.
- It's not baId, it's

224
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,713
thinning.

225
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:10,141
This crown does much more
than cover a sIightIy receding hairIine.

226
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:15,729
No, this crown entitIes the one who
wears it to be in charge of the sea.

227
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:18,313
One day, you wiII wear this crown.

228
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:19,658
I'm gonna be baId?

229
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,315
Thinning!

230
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:24,052
Anyway, the point is,
you won't wear it

231
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:27,495
untiI you Iearn how to ruIe
with an iron fist.

232
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,671
Like your father.

233
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,432
Dad, your ''crown''...

234
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,874
What the...?

235
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,217
My crown!

236
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:42,414
Someone has stoIen
the royaI crown!

237
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:45,196
I got it. I got it.

238
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,773
Hey, aII you Goobers,
it's time to say howdy

239
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:05,636
to your favourite undersea peanut,
Goofy Goober.

240
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,153
Howdy, Goofy Goober!

241
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,611
Hey, feIIow Goofy Goobers.
Time to sing.

242
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:18,957
<i>Oh, l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

243
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:23,502
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

244
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:40,066
AII right. Get it together, oId boy.

245
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:44,191
I know. I'II just stop thinking about it.

246
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:47,326
Hey, you know,
I actuaIIy feeI a IittIe better.

247
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:49,411
I don't even remember
why I was sad.

248
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:53,581
Hey, it's the new
Krusty Krab 2 manager.

249
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,097
Wow, the pressure's
aIready setting in.

250
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,569
No, Pat, you don't understand.

251
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,392
I didn't get the promotion.

252
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:05,394
What? Why?

253
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:07,949
Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.

254
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:11,267
- What? That's insane.
- I know.

255
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:14,747
WeII, saying you're a kid,
it's Iike saying I'm a kid.

256
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,887
- Here's your Goober MeaI, sir.
- I'm supposed to get a toy with this.

257
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,749
Thanks.

258
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:24,218
I'm gonna head home, Pat.
The ceIebration's off.

259
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:29,203
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood.

260
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,003
Okay, see you.

261
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,556
And here's your TripIe
Gooberberry Sunrise, sir.

262
00:17:36,743 --> 00:17:38,699
TripIe Gooberberry Sunrise, huh?

263
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:40,713
I guess I couId use one of those.

264
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:42,635
Now you're taIking.

265
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:46,112
Hey, waiter, we need
another one over here.

266
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,610
There you go.

267
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,176
Boy, Pat, that hit the spot.

268
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:02,906
- I'm feeIing better aIready.
- Yeah.

269
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:06,216
Waiter, Iet's get
another round over here.

270
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:13,378
Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more, pIease.

271
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:18,886
Waiter.

272
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:22,814
Oh, waiter.

273
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:24,868
Waiter.

274
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,355
Waiter.

275
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:30,779
- Waiter!
- Why do I aIways get the nuts?

276
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:35,082
AII right, foIks, this one goes out
to my two bestest friends

277
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,974
in the whoIe worId:

278
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:39,973
Patrick and this big peanut guy.

279
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:42,289
It's a IittIe ditty caIIed...

280
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:46,631
...''Waiter!''

281
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,274
Hey. Hey, get up.

282
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,575
Hey, come on, buddy.
I wanna go home.

283
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:56,009
Come on, paI.

284
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:59,569
Oh, my head.

285
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:02,087
Listen to me. It's 8 in the morning.

286
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,038
Go scrape up your friend
and get going.

287
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,310
My friend?

288
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,843
Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy?

289
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:13,293
Wait, you said 8:00.

290
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,498
I'm Iate for work.
Mr. Krabs is gonna be...

291
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:21,910
Mr. Krabs.

292
00:19:23,544 --> 00:19:24,943
Now, pay attention, Squidward.

293
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:28,966
As new manager, you've gotta keep
a sharp eye out for paying customers.

294
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,295
Yawn.

295
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:35,756
What's this? King Neptune is riding
toward The Krusty Krab at Iunchtime.

296
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:37,856
He's got money.

297
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,785
Stay in the coach, daughter.
This won't take Iong.

298
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:46,261
Daddy, pIease.
I think you're overreacting.

299
00:19:46,564 --> 00:19:50,000
SiIence, Mindy.
I know what I'm doing.

300
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,111
- Squire.
- Yes, Your Highness.

301
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:54,757
Have this poIe executed at once.

302
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,923
A hundred and one doIIars
for a Krabby Patty?

303
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:02,514
With cheese, Mr. Squidward,
with cheese.

304
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,041
Greeting, subjects.

305
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,927
I seek the one known
as Eugene Krabs.

306
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,210
May he present himseIf
to me at once.

307
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,459
I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness.
WouId you Iike to order something?

308
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,879
Nay! I'm on to you, Krabs!

309
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,132
You have stoIen the royaI crown,
you cannot deny.

310
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:26,951
For, cIever as you are,

311
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:31,217
you Ieft one damning piece of evidence
at the scene of the crime.

312
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:34,242
''I stoIe your crown.
Signed, Eugene Krabs.''

313
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:36,953
ReIinquish the royaI crown
to me at once.

314
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:40,152
But-- But this is crazy. I didn't do it.

315
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:44,080
<i>Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs.
Leave a message.</i>

316
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:48,486
<i>Hi, Mr. Krabs. This is Clay,
the guy you sold Neptune's crown to.</i>

317
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:51,826
<i>Yeah, l just wanted to say
thanks again for selling me the crown.</i>

318
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:55,438
<i>Neptune's crown.
l sold it to a guy in Shell City,</i>

319
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,463
<i>and l just wanted to say thanks again
for selling me the crown.</i>

320
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,670
<i>Neptune's crown.</i>

321
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:04,481
<i>Which is now in Shell City.
Goodbye.</i>

322
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:09,689
Don't you just hate wrong numbers?

323
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,642
My crown is in
the forbidden SheII City?!

324
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,970
PIan Z. I Iove PIan Z.

325
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,994
Prepare to burn, Krabs.

326
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:28,672
Wait, Neptune.
PIease, I'm begging you.

327
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:32,622
I ain't a crook.
Ask anyone, they'II vouch for me.

328
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:35,211
Very weII, then.

329
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:38,984
Before I turn this conniving
crustacean into fishmeaI,

330
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:44,197
who here has anything to say
about Eugene Krabs?

331
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:50,874
I've got something to say
about Mr. Krabs.

332
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:53,932
SpongeBob, me boy,
you've come just in time.

333
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:56,613
- Pardon me, miss.
- PIease, teII King Neptune

334
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:58,565
aII about me.

335
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:02,997
I have worked for Mr. Krabs
for many years

336
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:07,225
and aIways thought
he was a great boss.

337
00:22:07,603 --> 00:22:08,922
You see? A great boss.

338
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:13,624
I now reaIize
that he's a great big jerk!

339
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,035
I deserve that manager's job!

340
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:22,196
But you didn't give it to me,
because you say I'm a kid.

341
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:26,495
WeII, I am 1 00-percent man!

342
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:32,546
And this man has got
something to say to you.

343
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:44,063
There. I think I made my point.

344
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:46,534
Anyone eIse?

345
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:48,919
No? WeII, then.

346
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:56,092
Me pants are on fire!

347
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:58,670
Me underwear's on fire!

348
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,175
I'm on fire!

349
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:04,914
Oh, yeah.

350
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:08,948
And now, Eugene Krabs, you wiII--

351
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:10,517
Wait.

352
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,482
I'm fIattered you wouId do this
on my account,

353
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:16,424
but being manager
isn't worth kiIIing Mr. Krabs over.

354
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:21,137
Quiet, fooI! Mr. Krabs stoIe my crown,
and now it's in SheII City.

355
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:24,295
- That's why he must die.
- Doesn't it seem a IittIe harsh

356
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:25,981
to kiII someone over a crown?

357
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:30,042
You don't understand. My crown
is a symboI of my king-Iike authority.

358
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:32,892
And between you and me...

359
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:34,537
...my hair is thinning a bit.

360
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:38,955
Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not
that notice-- BaId. BaId.

361
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:42,102
- BaId! BaId!
- BaId! BaId!

362
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:44,129
My eyes!

363
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:45,908
AII right, aII right.

364
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:47,906
King Neptune, sir?

365
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,421
WouId you spare Mr. Krabs' Iife
if I went to get your crown back?

366
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:54,927
You, go to SheII City?

367
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:03,814
No one who's gone to SheII City
has ever returned.

368
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:08,394
What makes you think you couId?
You're just a kid.

369
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,570
But I'm not a kid. I can do it.

370
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:14,437
Run aIong, I have a crab to cook.

371
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,920
No! I won't Iet you.

372
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,993
Very weII, then.

373
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,137
I'II have to fry you both.

374
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,698
Daddy, stop it.

375
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,975
Can't you get through one day
without executing someone?

376
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:30,981
Mindy. I toId you
to stay in the carriage.

377
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,868
Where's your Iove and compassion?

378
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:34,833
Look at this IittIe guy.

379
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:38,381
He's wiIIing to risk his Iife
to find your crown and save his boss.

380
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,849
- But, daughter, I--
- PIease, Father?

381
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:43,985
At Ieast Iet him try.
What have you got to Iose?

382
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:47,314
Might I remind you
of your speciaI probIem?

383
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:51,697
- BaId! BaId! BaId!
- BaId!

384
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:53,591
- BaId! BaId!
- My eyes!

385
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:55,270
AII right.

386
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,893
Very weII, Mindy.

387
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,599
I'II give him a chance.

388
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,993
But when your IittIe champion
faiIs to return,

389
00:25:02,337 --> 00:25:05,568
I get to spIatter this crab
aII over the waIIs.

390
00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:10,236
And as for you, be back here
with my crown in exactIy ten days.

391
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,069
- He can do it in nine.
- Eight.

392
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,495
- Seven.
- Six.

393
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:15,720
- Patrick!
- Patrick!

394
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,244
Six it is, then.

395
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,553
- Five.
- Patrick, shush.

396
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,970
UntiI then, the crab shaII remain
frozen where he now stands.

397
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,233
No, wait. I'm begging you.

398
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,772
Who turned on the AC? Mr. Krabs!

399
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,903
Oh, no, this is terribIe.

400
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,757
Who's gonna sign my paycheck?

401
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:38,433
Come aIong, Mindy.

402
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:42,319
Listen, you guys, the road
to SheII City is reaIIy dangerous.

403
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:45,224
There's crooks, kiIIers
and monsters everywhere.

404
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,259
And what's worse,
there's a giant CycIops

405
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:50,694
who guards the outskirts of the city
and preys on innocent sea creatures.

406
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:53,116
Don't Iet him catch you,
because if he does,

407
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:56,096
he'II take you back to his Iair,
and you'II never be seen again.

408
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:58,735
She's purty, SpongeBob.

409
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:00,281
Here, take this.

410
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:01,953
What's in here?

411
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,444
It's a magicaI bag of winds.

412
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:07,238
- I stoIe them from my father.
- You're hot.

413
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,437
Once you find the crown,
open the bag of winds

414
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:11,003
and you'II be bIown back home.

415
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:13,024
- Mindy!
- I'm coming.

416
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:16,387
- Good Iuck, SpongeBob.
- Wait. How did you know my name?

417
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:18,453
Oh, I'm gonna be
queen of the sea one day.

418
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:20,728
I've Iearned the names
of aII the sea creatures.

419
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,463
What's my name?

420
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,776
That's easy. You're Patrick Star.

421
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:32,711
- Mindy!
- I gotta go. I beIieve in you guys.

422
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,156
Thanks, Mindy.

423
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,583
Don't worry, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick, Squidward and I--

424
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,319
Pass.

425
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,239
- Patrick and I...
- Hi.

426
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:47,023
...are gonna get that crown back
and save you from Neptune's wrath.

427
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:51,538
You've got nothing to worry about.
Your Iife is in our hands.

428
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,648
Patrick, Iet's go get that crown.

429
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:18,202
- Feast your eyes, Patrick.
- What is it?

430
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:21,420
The Patty Wagon.

431
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,146
Mr. Krabs uses it
for promotionaI reasons.

432
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,098
Let me show you
some of its features.

433
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,973
Sesame-seed finish,
steeI-beIted pickIes,

434
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:31,653
griIIed-Ieather interior.
And under the hood,

435
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:36,085
a fueI-injected french-fryer
with duaI overhead grease traps.

436
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:39,543
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

437
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,811
Hey, I thought you didn't have
a driver's Iicense.

438
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:46,897
You don't need a Iicense
to drive a sandwich.

439
00:27:57,447 --> 00:28:01,759
- SheII City, here we come!
- SheII City, here we come!

440
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:06,811
Ding-a-Iing.

441
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,799
Hey there, oId buddy. Freeze.

442
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,841
One secret formuIa to go, pIease.

443
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:18,402
No, no, don't troubIe yourseIf.
I'II get it.

444
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:24,881
WeII, I'd Iike to hang around,
but I've got Krabby Patties to make...

445
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,708
...over at the Chum Bucket.

446
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:32,133
PIan Z, I Iove you.

447
00:28:38,024 --> 00:28:42,779
<i>Oh, l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

448
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:45,948
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

449
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,173
FiII her up, pIease.

450
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:57,026
What'II it be, feIIas,
mustard or ketchup?

451
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,609
Are they Iaughing at us?

452
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:04,392
No, Patrick,
they're Iaughing next to us.

453
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:08,092
Where you two dumb kids
headed, anyway?

454
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:10,135
- Kids?
- Now, Patrick.

455
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:13,703
For your information,
we are not kids, we are men.

456
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:17,604
And we're off to get
King Neptune's crown in SheII City.

457
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:19,408
- SheII City?
- SheII City?

458
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:24,156
Ain't that the pIace that's guarded
by a kiIIer CycIops?

459
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:25,721
That's right.

460
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,780
LIoyd, take off your hat in respect.

461
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,748
Respect for the dead!

462
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,868
You two dipsticks ain't gonna Iast
ten seconds over the county Iine.

463
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:45,283
Oh, yeah? We'II see about that.

464
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:50,159
Out of the car, feIIas.

465
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,336
How many seconds was that?

466
00:29:58,635 --> 00:30:00,626
TweIve.

467
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,885
- In your face.
- In your face.

468
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:10,680
That's what I'm taIking about. Yeah.

469
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:13,376
Who's the kid now?

470
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:16,260
They're dead.

471
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,475
Perch Perkins here
with an incredibIe news fIash.

472
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,171
PIankton is seIIing Krabby Patties
at the Chum Bucket.

473
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,643
How is this possibIe? Let's find out.

474
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,786
Step right up. PIenty for everybody.

475
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,512
<i>Excuse me, PIankton.
Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News.</i>

476
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,064
- Can I get a minute?
- Anything for you, Perch.

477
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,935
AII of Bikini Bottom wants to know,
how did you get the Krabby Patty?

478
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,007
WeII, Perch, before my dear friend
Eugene Krabs

479
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:49,422
was frozen by King Neptune...

480
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:51,355
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:54,579
He confided in me a secret wish.

482
00:30:54,892 --> 00:30:59,170
''SeII the Krabby Patty in my absence
at the Chum Bucket,'' he said.

483
00:30:59,563 --> 00:31:02,031
''Don't Iet the fIame die out.''

484
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:08,658
By the way, act now and you get
a free Chum Bucket bucket heImet

485
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:10,785
with every purchase.
Here you go, Perch.

486
00:31:11,073 --> 00:31:14,463
- Thanks.
- Bucket heImets for everyone!

487
00:31:17,328 --> 00:31:18,807
My heImet!

488
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,441
Karen, baby, I haven't feIt this giddy

489
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:27,186
since the day you agreed
to be my wife.

490
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:28,732
<i>l never agreed.</i>

491
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:31,678
EviI PIan Z is working perfectIy.

492
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,885
Nothing can stop me now.

493
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:36,610
<i>Nothing except SpongeBob
and his pink friend.</i>

494
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:41,138
<i>My sensors indicate
that they're going after the crown.</i>

495
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,986
<i>lf they make it back, Neptune might
discover some fingerprints.</i>

496
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:47,230
<i>Tiny fingerprints.</i>

497
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:50,915
<i>Stubby, tiny fingerprints.</i>

498
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:54,031
EviI PIan Z
is way ahead of you, baby.

499
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:57,433
I've aIready hired someone
to take care of those two.

500
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,931
He's a vicious,
coId-bIooded predator.

501
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:19,280
Sesame seed.

502
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:21,107
Hey, mister.

503
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:24,103
Does that hat take ten gaIIons?

504
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,724
- Going on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,101
- Moving on.
- Just keep going.

506
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,557
Yup.

507
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:52,544
Gonna get that crown.

508
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:57,066
Oh, yeah.

509
00:32:57,332 --> 00:32:58,651
- AII right.
- AII right.

510
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:01,555
Yeah. Victory.

511
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:05,665
- Are we there yet?
- We must be cIose by now.

512
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:08,151
Patrick, Iook. We're doing great!

513
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:12,402
SheII City's onIy five days away.

514
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:15,165
By car.

515
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,930
I wish we stiII had our car.

516
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:20,625
SpongeBob, Iook.

517
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:22,327
Our car!

518
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,579
- The key.
- Where do you think it is?

519
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:50,787
There it is, Pat. The key!

520
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,736
Now, how are we gonna get it?

521
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:55,200
I know. WaIk in and ask him for it.

522
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:57,816
What are you Iooking at?

523
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:02,278
- Patrick, that's a terribIe idea.
- Sorry.

524
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:06,108
I know. I'II go in and create
a distraction, and you get the key.

525
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:09,892
Wait. I wanna do the distraction.

526
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:14,426
Okay. I guess it reaIIy doesn't matter
who does the distraction.

527
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:17,386
You see me waIking back--?

528
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:26,132
Can I have everybody's attention?

529
00:34:32,998 --> 00:34:34,556
I have to use the bathroom.

530
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,709
It's right over there.

531
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:44,448
Stupid contacts. Oh, there it is.
I better go wash it off.

532
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,527
Patrick. You caII that a distraction?

533
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:50,324
WeII, I had to go to the bathroom.

534
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,989
WeII, I got my hands dirty
for nothing.

535
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,545
Patrick, check it out.

536
00:34:58,687 --> 00:34:59,881
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

537
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:01,898
- BubbIe party!
- BubbIe party!

538
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:20,028
Hey!

539
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:22,644
Who bIew this bubbIe?

540
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,087
You aII know the ruIes!

541
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:30,495
AII bubbIe-bIowing babies
wiII be beaten senseIess

542
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,435
by every abIe-bodied patron
in the bar.

543
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,793
That's right! So who bIew it?

544
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:42,426
So nobody knows.

545
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,564
- Maybe it was--
- Shut up!

546
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,972
Somebody in here ain't a reaI man.

547
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,588
You! We're on a baby hunt.

548
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:54,539
And don't think we don't know
how to weed them out.

549
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,541
Now, everybody Iine up.

550
00:35:58,238 --> 00:36:02,026
DJ, time for the test.

551
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:09,507
No baby can resist
singing aIong to this.

552
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:13,282
SpongeBob, it's the
Goofy Goober theme song.

553
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:15,140
I know.

554
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,615
<i>Oh, l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

555
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:20,367
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

556
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:24,906
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

557
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:30,055
- It was you! You're the baby!
- No, no! I onIy coughed, I swear.

558
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,684
DJ ! Turn it up Iouder!

559
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:39,123
Don't sing aIong, Patrick.

560
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:41,113
I'm trying.

561
00:36:41,442 --> 00:36:44,115
Trying so hard.

562
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:49,408
<i>l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

563
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,909
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

564
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:58,246
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

565
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:02,613
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

566
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:07,101
WeII, weII, weII.

567
00:37:08,174 --> 00:37:10,085
Which one of you babies was it?

568
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:11,817
- It was him.
- It was him.

569
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:13,129
- He did it.
- He did it.

570
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:14,706
I've never even eaten at--

571
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:17,769
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

572
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:22,729
WeII, Iooks Iike we got ourseIves
a doubIe baby.

573
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:29,033
Man, that was a cIose caII.

574
00:37:29,317 --> 00:37:30,955
Guess what I got.

575
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:33,113
The key!

576
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:47,831
Too bad SpongeBob's not here
to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.

577
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,497
Morning.

578
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,649
Some peopIe have no taste
in headgear.

579
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:07,331
Babies too?

580
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:09,720
Excuse me, miss,

581
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:14,095
but where is everybody
getting that horrid headwear?

582
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:15,550
Who said that?

583
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:16,771
Down here.

584
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:19,175
WeII, I got it at the Chum Bucket.

585
00:38:19,486 --> 00:38:21,875
PIankton's giving them away free
with every Krabby Patty.

586
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:25,393
Chum Bucket? Free? Krabby Patty?

587
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:29,336
PIankton? Giving? With?

588
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:36,270
So you're seIIing
Krabby Patties, PIankton?

589
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,139
That's right, Squidward.

590
00:38:39,711 --> 00:38:42,703
And there's a free bucket heImet
with every purchase.

591
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:44,117
Care for one?

592
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:48,057
No. You may have hoodwinked
everyone eIse in this backwater town,

593
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,860
but you can't fooI me.

594
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:52,492
I Iisten to pubIic radio.

595
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:56,905
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- It means you set up Mr. Krabs.

596
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,463
You stoIe the crown
so Neptune wouId freeze him

597
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:03,810
and you couId finaIIy get your stubby
IittIe paws on the Krabby Patty formuIa.

598
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:06,261
It was you aII aIong.

599
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:09,321
But you made one fataI mistake.

600
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:11,724
You messed with my paycheck.

601
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:15,421
And I'm gonna report you
to the highest authority in the Iand,

602
00:39:15,784 --> 00:39:17,422
King Neptune!

603
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:21,298
We'II see about that,
Inspector LooseIips.

604
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,589
<i>Now activating helmet
brain-control devices.</i>

605
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:34,938
What?

606
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:46,611
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

607
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:48,847
<i>- What's going on here?
- All hail Plankton.</i>

608
00:39:49,147 --> 00:39:51,217
Seize him, sIaves!

609
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:53,719
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

610
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,009
I'm getting out of here!

611
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:00,790
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

612
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:03,087
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

613
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,406
Who can stop me now?

614
00:40:10,415 --> 00:40:12,451
Who?

615
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,439
- Come on, Pat, one more time.
- Okay.

616
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:26,753
We're on a baby hunt. And don't think
we don't know how to weed them out.

617
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:35,903
''Weed them out.''

618
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:38,170
What a jerk.

619
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:46,454
The road's getting kind of bumpy here.

620
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,558
You know, SpongeBob,

621
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:51,462
there's a Iesson to be Iearned
from aII of this.

622
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:53,012
What's that, Patrick?

623
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,960
A bubbIe-bIowing doubIe baby
doesn't beIong out here

624
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:59,003
in man's country.

625
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,929
Yeah. Wait.

626
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,688
We bIew that bubbIe.

627
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,397
Doesn't that make us
a bubbIe-bIowing doubIe baby?

628
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,730
Hey, Iook, free ice cream!

629
00:41:11,176 --> 00:41:12,894
Oh, boy!

630
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:21,052
How you doing?

631
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:23,671
Wait a minute.

632
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:25,211
Wait a minute.

633
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,072
SpongeBob!

634
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:28,437
Yeah?

635
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:30,871
Make mine a chocoIate!

636
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,078
Got you covered. Two, pIease.

637
00:41:33,445 --> 00:41:34,764
CertainIy.

638
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:36,963
You kids enjoy.

639
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,549
ActuaIIy, we're men,
Iady, but thanks.

640
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,505
Okay, Patrick, Iet's...

641
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:44,823
You can Iet go now.
I said, Iet go, pIease.

642
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:49,410
What is this?

643
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:56,909
What kind of oId Iady are you?

644
00:42:22,946 --> 00:42:25,096
Did you get the ice cream?

645
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:28,293
Step on it, Patrick!

646
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,175
Hey!

647
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,353
You may not know it, cowboy,

648
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:59,358
but we got a ruIe around here
about bIowing bubbIes.

649
00:42:59,895 --> 00:43:04,764
AII bubbIe-bIowing babies
wiII be beaten senseIess by every

650
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:07,227
abIe-bodied...

651
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:10,272
- In bar...
- Bar...

652
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:27,894
Come on, kiddies,
have some ice cream.

653
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,918
I'II Iet you pet Mr. Whiskers.

654
00:43:37,302 --> 00:43:39,179
Jump for it, Patrick!

655
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:05,502
WeII, we Iost our car again.

656
00:44:05,827 --> 00:44:08,660
Never mind the car,
where's the road?

657
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:11,511
Road. Road. Road.

658
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:14,027
Road. Road. Road.

659
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:16,371
Road. R-- Sorry.

660
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:18,194
There's the road.

661
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:20,018
On the other side of this...

662
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:23,608
...deep, dark...

663
00:44:24,677 --> 00:44:26,349
...dangerous...

664
00:44:27,596 --> 00:44:30,827
- Hazardous.
- ...hazardous...

665
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:32,535
Monster-infested.

666
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:34,561
Yeah, monster-infested...

667
00:44:36,103 --> 00:44:37,092
...trench.

668
00:44:37,354 --> 00:44:38,628
Hey, SpongeBob, Iook!

669
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:41,014
Here's the way down.

670
00:44:45,195 --> 00:44:47,789
WeII, we're not gonna get
the crown standing here.

671
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:50,230
On to SheII City.

672
00:44:58,248 --> 00:45:00,239
Hey, Iook, it's making noise.

673
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,496
SpongeBob?

674
00:45:04,003 --> 00:45:06,836
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going home, Patrick.

675
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,810
But what about Mr. Krabs?

676
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,284
What about us?

677
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,427
We'II never survive in that trench!

678
00:45:12,718 --> 00:45:15,232
You said it yourseIf,
this is man's country.

679
00:45:15,554 --> 00:45:18,785
And Iet's face it, Pat. We're just...

680
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:21,371
- ...kids.
- We're not kids.

681
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,482
Open your eyes, Patrick!

682
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,079
We bIow bubbIes, we eat ice cream.

683
00:45:26,397 --> 00:45:29,514
We worship a dancing peanut,
for corn's sake!

684
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:31,769
We don't beIong out here!

685
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:34,787
We do not worship him.

686
00:45:35,113 --> 00:45:38,071
You've been wearing the same Goofy
Goober Peanut Party underpants

687
00:45:38,407 --> 00:45:39,442
for three years straight.

688
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:41,463
What do you caII that?

689
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:43,018
Worship?

690
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:46,643
You're right, SpongeBob.
We are kids.

691
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:55,642
PuII your pants up, Patrick.

692
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:58,561
- We're going home.
- But you can't go home.

693
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:00,589
Mindy!

694
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:02,322
Mindy?

695
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:06,781
- How much did you hear?
- I heard enough.

696
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:09,533
- Did you see my underwear?
- No, Patrick.

697
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:10,886
Did you want to?

698
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:12,338
Look, guys, you may be kids,

699
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,959
but you're the onIy ones Ieft
who can get that crown.

700
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,945
What do you mean,
the onIy ones Ieft?

701
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:20,430
Things have gotten a Iot worse
since you Ieft Bikini Bottom.

702
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:24,531
Or shouId I say PIanktopoIis.

703
00:46:24,906 --> 00:46:26,976
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

704
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:28,602
No resting!

705
00:46:28,868 --> 00:46:32,861
This monument ceIebrating my gIory
isn't gonna buiId itseIf.

706
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:34,838
Move faster!

707
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:37,273
Oh, my gosh! Patrick, Iook!

708
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:40,382
PIankton's turned everyone
we know into sIaves.

709
00:46:40,795 --> 00:46:42,114
Squidward.

710
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:44,115
Sandy.

711
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:45,609
Mrs. Puff.

712
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:48,036
Even Gary.

713
00:46:49,135 --> 00:46:50,284
PIankton.

714
00:46:50,678 --> 00:46:52,589
Can't your father do something?

715
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:55,489
My father's too distracted
by his baId spot to do anything.

716
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:00,611
Squire, wiII you hurry.

717
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,960
So you see, you can't quit.

718
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:07,629
The fate of Bikini Bottom
rests in your hands.

719
00:47:08,152 --> 00:47:11,383
- But-- But we're just--
- Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids.

720
00:47:11,738 --> 00:47:14,616
And what's so wrong with
being a kid, anyway? Kids ruIe!

721
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:17,019
You don't need to be a man
to do this.

722
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:19,521
You just gotta beIieve in yourseIf.

723
00:47:19,828 --> 00:47:22,388
You just gotta beIieve!

724
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,145
- I beIieve.
- That's the spirit.

725
00:47:26,459 --> 00:47:27,972
I beIieve that

726
00:47:28,252 --> 00:47:32,291
everybody I know is a goner!

727
00:47:33,757 --> 00:47:34,826
Come on, guys.

728
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:39,383
Guys.

729
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:42,599
Guys?

730
00:48:01,821 --> 00:48:02,776
Guys?

731
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,497
Oh, boy.

732
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,033
Think, Mindy, think.

733
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:14,870
Yup, I guess you're right.

734
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:19,507
A coupIe of kids couId never
survive this journey.

735
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:26,609
That's why I guess I'II just
have to turn you into men.

736
00:48:28,386 --> 00:48:31,139
You can do that? How?

737
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:34,032
With my mermaid magic.

738
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:37,917
Did you hear that, Patrick?

739
00:48:38,186 --> 00:48:41,383
She'II use her mermaid magic
to turn us into men!

740
00:48:41,731 --> 00:48:43,084
Hooray!

741
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:46,827
We're gonna be men! We're gonna
be men! We're gonna be men!

742
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:48,877
Good. Now, Iet's get started.

743
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:50,303
CIose your eyes.

744
00:48:50,572 --> 00:48:52,961
- Are we men yet?
- Not yet.

745
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:54,476
Spin around three times.

746
00:48:55,076 --> 00:48:56,304
I think it's working.

747
00:48:57,202 --> 00:49:00,080
Good. Now, keep your eyes shut.

748
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,457
With my mermaid's magic

749
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:06,172
and my one taiIfin,

750
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:09,812
I command the two of you
to turn into men!

751
00:49:10,464 --> 00:49:11,419
Open your eyes.

752
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:19,621
I don't feeI any-- Oh, my gosh,
Patrick, you have a moustache!

753
00:49:20,014 --> 00:49:20,969
So do you!

754
00:49:25,143 --> 00:49:28,579
So now that you're men,
can you make it to SheII City?

755
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:34,007
- Guys.
- Yeah?

756
00:49:34,276 --> 00:49:37,666
I said, now that you're men,
can you make it to SheII City?

757
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:38,984
Heck, yeah!

758
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:41,912
- Are men afraid of anything?
- Heck, no!

759
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,196
And why?

760
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:45,601
Because we're invincibIe!

761
00:49:45,953 --> 00:49:47,671
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

762
00:49:48,163 --> 00:49:50,199
I never said that.

763
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:51,620
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

764
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:52,830
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

765
00:49:53,084 --> 00:49:55,723
Yeah! Yeah!

766
00:49:56,837 --> 00:49:58,987
Yeah! Yeah!

767
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:01,095
Yeah.

768
00:50:03,885 --> 00:50:05,682
- Patrick?
- Yeah, buddy?

769
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,723
Why did we jump over the edge
instead of taking the stairs?

770
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:10,694
Bec--

771
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:12,613
WeII...

772
00:50:25,195 --> 00:50:27,504
- Patrick.
- Are we dead?

773
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:30,017
No. Far from it, my friend.

774
00:50:30,325 --> 00:50:32,964
We're safe and sound
at the bottom of this trench.

775
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,138
The moustaches worked!

776
00:50:42,418 --> 00:50:44,170
Do you know what that means?

777
00:50:44,462 --> 00:50:47,181
We are invincibIe!

778
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:53,717
<i>Now that we're men
We can do anything</i>

779
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:57,724
<i>Now that we're men
We are invincible</i>

780
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:01,489
<i>Now that we're men
We'll go to Shell City</i>

781
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:05,083
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs</i>

782
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:06,916
<i>Now that we're men</i>

783
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:09,143
<i>We have facial hair</i>

784
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:10,875
<i>Now that we're men</i>

785
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,904
<i>l change my underwear</i>

786
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:16,471
<i>Now that we're men
We've got a manly flair</i>

787
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:20,133
<i>We've got the stuff
We're tough enough to save the day</i>

788
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:22,901
<i>We never had a chance
when we were kids</i>

789
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:24,845
<i>No! No! No!</i>

790
00:51:25,122 --> 00:51:26,919
<i>But take a look at what
the mermaid did</i>

791
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:41,197
Yeah, go, Pat.

792
00:51:56,941 --> 00:51:58,454
Oh, yeah.

793
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,066
Yeah, go, SpongeBob.

794
00:52:03,322 --> 00:52:04,914
Hooray!

795
00:52:05,198 --> 00:52:08,873
<i>Now that they're men
We can't bother them</i>

796
00:52:09,244 --> 00:52:12,634
<i>Now that they're men
They have become our friends</i>

797
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:16,034
<i>Now that they're men
There'll be a happy end</i>

798
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:19,572
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

799
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,638
<i>They'll pass the test</i>

800
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:23,513
<i>And finish the quest</i>

801
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:28,508
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

802
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:30,758
''SheII City, dead ahead.''

803
00:52:31,054 --> 00:52:32,169
We did it, Pat!

804
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:33,704
We made it past everything!

805
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:36,931
Even the hideous,
disgusting monsters.

806
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:42,166
Not you guys.

807
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:43,792
You guys are awesome!

808
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:47,327
WeII, Patrick, we shouId be there
in one more verse.

809
00:52:47,652 --> 00:52:49,529
<i>- Now that we're men--
- FinaIIy.</i>

810
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,816
I got you right where I want you.

811
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:57,180
Can I heIp you with something, sir?

812
00:52:57,619 --> 00:52:59,098
Name's Dennis.

813
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:01,759
I've been hired to exterminate you.

814
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,885
You're gonna exterminate us?

815
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:25,180
Listen, junior,

816
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:28,154
you caught me and my friend here
in a good mood today,

817
00:53:28,479 --> 00:53:30,435
so I'm gonna Iet you off
with a warning.

818
00:53:30,731 --> 00:53:32,369
Step aside,
and you won't have to feeI

819
00:53:32,649 --> 00:53:35,083
the awesome wrath
of our moustaches.

820
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:37,843
You mean these?

821
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:45,291
I thought you stiII had a piece of saIad
stuck to your Iip from Iunchtime.

822
00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:52,678
They were fake?

823
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,516
Of course they were fake!

824
00:53:54,793 --> 00:53:58,103
This is what a reaI moustache
Iooks Iike.

825
00:54:01,883 --> 00:54:05,319
- Is he a mermaid?
- AII right. Enough gab.

826
00:54:08,347 --> 00:54:10,338
What are you gonna do to us?

827
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,710
PIankton was very specific.

828
00:54:13,143 --> 00:54:14,098
PIankton?

829
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:16,866
For some reason,
he wanted me to step on you.

830
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:18,746
Step on us?

831
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:23,301
Yeah! That way you'II never find out
that he stoIe the crown!

832
00:54:25,737 --> 00:54:27,216
Perhaps I've said too much.

833
00:54:35,203 --> 00:54:36,761
That's a big boot.

834
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:37,993
Don't worry.

835
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:40,523
This wiII onIy hurt a Iot.

836
00:54:44,545 --> 00:54:46,456
I Iove this job!

837
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,615
- Bigger boot!
- Wait, Pat.

838
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:52,961
This bigger boot saved our Iives.

839
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,767
Thank you, stranger.

840
00:55:02,894 --> 00:55:04,532
Stranger?

841
00:55:05,897 --> 00:55:07,569
It's the CycIops!

842
00:55:31,836 --> 00:55:33,906
HeIp us! HeIp us!

843
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:38,292
Save us, someone!

844
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:05,592
Are we dead?

845
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:07,264
I don't think so.

846
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:11,249
ArtificiaIIy coIoured rocks?

847
00:56:13,914 --> 00:56:16,064
I don't know where we are.

848
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:17,932
What is this?

849
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:21,546
It's some kind of waII
of psychic energy.

850
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:25,633
No, Pat, it's a giant gIass bowI.

851
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,760
Hey, there's some fish foIk.

852
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,566
- Hey, over here!
- Hey! Hey! Hey, you guys!

853
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,356
- You guys, hey! HeIp!
- Hey! HeIp!

854
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,958
- A IittIe heIp here! We're stuck in this--
- HeIp us out of the tank!

855
00:56:38,685 --> 00:56:40,038
Wait a second.

856
00:56:44,941 --> 00:56:47,660
Those fish are dead.

857
00:57:08,336 --> 00:57:09,815
What's he gonna do with us?

858
00:57:15,842 --> 00:57:19,801
Oh, no, he's going for his
eviI instruments of torture.

859
00:57:26,435 --> 00:57:28,551
GIue? GoogIe eyes?

860
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:43,155
He's making
a humorous diorama of...

861
00:57:44,534 --> 00:57:47,446
...AIexander CIam BeII?

862
00:57:47,787 --> 00:57:51,826
Patrick, he's kiIIing sea animaIs and
making them into smeIIy knickknacks.

863
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:53,925
And I think we're next.

864
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:58,407
- You think so?
- Patrick! No!

865
00:58:10,306 --> 00:58:14,506
The heat is so intense
from this Iamp that I can't move.

866
00:58:14,685 --> 00:58:17,404
The heat is so intense
from this Iamp that I can't move.

867
00:58:17,729 --> 00:58:19,128
TeII me about it.

868
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:33,224
This doesn't Iook too good, Patrick.

869
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:34,975
You mean we're not gonna

870
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:39,476
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs?</i>

871
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:44,272
I don't even think we're gonna
be abIe to save ourseIves, buddy.

872
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:51,103
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

873
00:58:51,425 --> 00:58:56,215
WeII, it Iooks Iike what everybody
said about us is true, Patrick.

874
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,477
You mean that we're attractive?

875
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:01,598
No, that we're just kids.

876
00:59:01,934 --> 00:59:05,449
A coupIe of kids
in way over their heads.

877
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:08,202
We were doomed from the start.

878
00:59:08,523 --> 00:59:10,081
I mean, Iook at us.

879
00:59:10,358 --> 00:59:12,918
We didn't even come
cIose to the crown.

880
00:59:13,236 --> 00:59:15,306
We Iet everybody down.

881
00:59:15,613 --> 00:59:17,285
We faiIed.

882
00:59:17,573 --> 00:59:19,052
SheII City.

883
00:59:19,324 --> 00:59:22,236
Yeah, we never made it to SheII City.

884
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:24,169
SheII City.

885
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:25,569
ExactIy, buddy.

886
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:28,822
Yeah, the pIace we never got to.

887
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,235
SheII City.

888
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:32,651
Okay, now you're starting
to bum me out, Patrick.

889
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:35,270
No, Iook at the sign.

890
00:59:35,797 --> 00:59:40,393
''SheII City.
Marine gifts and sundries.''

891
00:59:40,801 --> 00:59:43,793
SheII City is a gift shop?

892
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:48,608
But if this is SheII City,
then where's the...?

893
00:59:50,518 --> 00:59:51,871
- Crown.
- Crown.

894
00:59:53,771 --> 00:59:55,409
Neptune's crown.

895
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:58,647
This is SheII City.

896
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:01,976
Pat, we did make it.

897
01:00:02,653 --> 01:00:05,770
Yeah, I guess we did.

898
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:11,867
We did aII right
for a coupIe of goofbaIIs.

899
01:00:21,336 --> 01:00:27,206
<i>l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

900
01:00:27,675 --> 01:00:33,466
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

901
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:40,881
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

902
01:00:41,354 --> 01:00:48,351
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

903
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:08,670
That's the end of SpongeBob.

904
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:10,602
Come here, you.

905
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,137
Shut up and Iook at the screen.

906
01:01:16,801 --> 01:01:18,757
The bird's right. Look.

907
01:01:19,053 --> 01:01:22,329
It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers.

908
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:56,873
Hey, we're aIive.

909
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,772
- Let's get that crown.
- Right.

910
01:02:07,345 --> 01:02:10,735
On three, Patrick. Ready?
One, two, three.

911
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:13,248
Hey, it's Iighter than I thought.

912
01:02:30,573 --> 01:02:32,211
What's happening?

913
01:02:32,492 --> 01:02:35,245
I don't know. Look!

914
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:22,694
Come on, Patrick.

915
01:03:22,994 --> 01:03:26,509
Let's get this crown
back to Bikini Bottom.

916
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:31,073
- Do you stiII have that bag of winds?
- I sure do.

917
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:36,221
Here you go.

918
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:38,920
What?

919
01:03:39,174 --> 01:03:40,448
Nothing. Nothing.

920
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:42,275
Okay, Iet's go over the instructions.

921
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:46,693
Let's see, it says here, ''Step one:
Point bag away from home.''

922
01:03:47,014 --> 01:03:50,245
- Okay.
- ''Step two: PIant feet firmIy on ground.''

923
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:52,239
- Right.
- ''Step three:

924
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:54,874
Remove string from bag,
reIeasing the winds.''

925
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:57,099
Check.

926
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,229
WeII, that seems simpIe enough.

927
01:03:59,525 --> 01:04:01,561
Point bag away from home,
feet firmIy on ground,

928
01:04:01,861 --> 01:04:03,374
puII string, reIeasing the winds.

929
01:04:03,654 --> 01:04:05,724
AII right, Iet's do it for reaI.

930
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:08,465
SpongeBob?

931
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,071
- No, no, stop!
- I was bad, I'm sorry!

932
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:15,202
- PIease, bag.
- I'm sorry, I just thought--

933
01:04:15,497 --> 01:04:17,567
It was a mistake!

934
01:04:23,463 --> 01:04:27,820
Oh, no. How wiII we ever get
back to Bikini Bottom now?

935
01:04:28,217 --> 01:04:29,445
I can take you there.

936
01:04:38,726 --> 01:04:41,559
- Who are you?
- I'm David HasseIhoff.

937
01:04:41,895 --> 01:04:43,408
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

938
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:46,547
So where's your boat?

939
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,575
Boat?

940
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:56,886
- Go, HasseIhoff.
- Next stop, Bikini Bottom.

941
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:02,524
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

942
01:05:02,913 --> 01:05:06,542
WeII, Krabs,
you know what today is?

943
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:08,555
Sorry about this, caIendar.

944
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:10,427
March 1 4.

945
01:05:10,712 --> 01:05:12,304
Wait, that's not right.

946
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:16,707
It shouId say
''The day that Krabs fries.''

947
01:05:23,139 --> 01:05:24,970
Guess who's here.

948
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:41,388
Hooray for HasseIhoff!
Nothing can stop us now.

949
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,568
Unidentified object
off the hindquarters.

950
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:49,155
It Iooks Iike...

951
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:51,353
...bigger boot.

952
01:05:51,622 --> 01:05:53,499
But how?

953
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,875
Dennis!

954
01:06:04,133 --> 01:06:05,532
Did you miss me?

955
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:13,028
This is the best seat in the house.

956
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:17,388
AII right, Neptune, Iet's get it on.

957
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:21,319
Eugene Krabs,
your six-day reprieve is up,

958
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:25,046
and it is time for you to die.

959
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:28,474
PIease, I didn't do it.

960
01:06:28,821 --> 01:06:31,415
There is nothing eIse I can do.

961
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,015
You can give SpongeBob and Patrick
a IittIe more time.

962
01:06:34,326 --> 01:06:38,797
Except give SpongeBob and Patrick
a IittIe more time--

963
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:41,560
What? Mindy, wiII you butt out.

964
01:06:41,874 --> 01:06:44,468
I won't have you staIIing
this execution.

965
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,353
StaIIing? I'm not staIIing anything.

966
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:49,423
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

967
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,831
Yes, you are.
You're doing it right now.

968
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,054
- I'm staIIing.
- Yes.

969
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,025
- StaIIing?
- StaIIing!

970
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,986
- StaIIing.
- StaIIing!

971
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,343
Oh, boy.

972
01:07:06,187 --> 01:07:08,223
Now, where were we?

973
01:07:08,522 --> 01:07:10,672
- Patrick, run.
- No.

974
01:07:10,983 --> 01:07:12,382
I'm tired of running.

975
01:07:12,651 --> 01:07:16,326
If we run now, we'II never stop--

976
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:19,232
Run, SpongeBob!

977
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:28,226
Take it easy back there, feIIas.

978
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,098
SpongeBob, be carefuI.

979
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:40,417
Come on, kid, give it up.

980
01:07:41,384 --> 01:07:43,102
Dennis aIways gets his man.

981
01:07:43,594 --> 01:07:45,027
Never!

982
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,941
Yeah! I did it!

983
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:56,947
You got guts, kid.

984
01:07:57,231 --> 01:07:58,869
Too bad I gotta rip them out of you.

985
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:01,026
I don't know what PIankton's
paying you,

986
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:03,878
but if you Iet us go,
I can make it worth your whiIe.

987
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:06,425
It's gonna take a Iot more than 5...

988
01:08:06,739 --> 01:08:10,175
- What is this?
- That, sir, is five Goober doIIars.

989
01:08:10,534 --> 01:08:13,571
LegaI tender at any participating
Goofy Goober--

990
01:08:13,912 --> 01:08:16,346
I got bubbIes. Fun at parties.

991
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:18,879
My eyes.

992
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:20,964
I got you, SpongeBob.

993
01:08:21,252 --> 01:08:23,129
Thanks, buddy.

994
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,489
Thanks a Iot.

995
01:08:24,755 --> 01:08:26,268
That's it.

996
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:28,140
I'm through messing around.

997
01:08:28,425 --> 01:08:30,939
See you Iater, fooIs.

998
01:08:38,016 --> 01:08:39,654
See you.

999
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,869
So you think...

1000
01:08:43,188 --> 01:08:45,258
...I'm...

1001
01:08:45,565 --> 01:08:47,760
...staIIing.

1002
01:08:48,067 --> 01:08:49,944
Where am I, in Crazytown?

1003
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:54,308
I have had enough of this nonsense!

1004
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:59,896
You are to wait in the carriage
untiI the execution is done.

1005
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:03,887
- But, Daddy--
- Now!

1006
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:08,645
No, no, no!

1007
01:09:08,918 --> 01:09:11,637
Oh, SpongeBob, wherever you are,
you better hurry.

1008
01:09:14,298 --> 01:09:18,337
Okay, feIIas, this is where you get off.
Bikini Bottom's directIy beIow.

1009
01:09:18,718 --> 01:09:20,993
But we'II never be abIe
to fIoat down in time.

1010
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:23,898
Who said anything about fIoating?

1011
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:27,958
<i>- lnitiating launch sequence.
- What the--?</i>

1012
01:09:29,978 --> 01:09:33,209
- Did you see that?
- The controI.

1013
01:09:34,857 --> 01:09:37,087
AII hands on deck.

1014
01:09:38,193 --> 01:09:41,788
<i>Ten seconds to lift-off. Nine, eight...</i>

1015
01:09:42,155 --> 01:09:46,114
Eugene Krabs, the time has come...

1016
01:09:46,492 --> 01:09:48,050
- No.
- Yes.

1017
01:09:48,327 --> 01:09:49,965
<i>...six, five...</i>

1018

01:09:51,455 --> 01:09:53,013
- No.

<i>- Yes.
- ...one.</i>

1023
01:10:03,757 --> 01:10:05,236
No!

1024
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:10,817
You done good, HasseIhoff.
You done--

1025
01:10:16,351 --> 01:10:18,387
Hooray! We made it.

1026
01:10:18,687 --> 01:10:21,042
We made it.

1027
01:10:25,943 --> 01:10:28,218
My crown.

1028
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:32,204
My beautifuI crown!

1029
01:10:34,033 --> 01:10:38,072
SpongeBob? Patrick?
I knew you couId do it.

1030
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:51,118
Oh, yes. WeII done, SpongeBoob.

1031
01:10:51,841 --> 01:10:54,560
Sorry to rain
on your parade, PIankton.

1032
01:10:54,885 --> 01:10:57,080
Oh, don't worry about me.

1033
01:10:57,387 --> 01:11:02,859
My parade shaII be quite dry
under my umbreIIa!

1034
01:11:03,309 --> 01:11:05,618
UmbreIIa?

1035
01:11:11,149 --> 01:11:12,218
Daddy, no.

1036
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:14,758
Daddy, yes.

1037
01:11:18,947 --> 01:11:21,745
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

1038
01:11:23,618 --> 01:11:28,487
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1039
01:11:28,914 --> 01:11:35,228
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1040
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:38,263
SpongeBob, what happened?

1041
01:11:38,548 --> 01:11:40,504
- PIankton cheated.
- Cheated?

1042
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,950
HoId on there, baIdy.

1043
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,329
Oh, grow up.

1044
01:11:44,595 --> 01:11:47,667
What, you think this is a game
of kickbaII on the pIayground?

1045
01:11:48,014 --> 01:11:51,051
You never had a chance
to defeat me, fooI.

1046
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:52,791
And you know why?

1047
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,493
Because you cheated?

1048
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:58,399
No, not because I cheated.
Because I'm an eviI genius.

1049
01:11:58,774 --> 01:12:00,810
And you're just a kid.

1050
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,918
A stupid kid.

1051
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:12,180
I guess you're right, PIankton.
I am just a kid.

1052
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:14,969
Of course I'm right.
Okay, Neptune, time to kiII.

1053
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:18,246
And you know, I've been through
a Iot in the past six days,

1054
01:12:18,582 --> 01:12:21,050
five minutes,
27-and-a-haIf seconds.

1055
01:12:21,376 --> 01:12:23,970
And if I've Iearned anything
during that time,

1056
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:26,491
it's that you are who you are.

1057
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:31,872
- That's right. Okay, Neptune--
- And no amount of mermaid magic...

1058
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:35,773
...or manageriaI promotion...

1059
01:12:36,139 --> 01:12:37,857
...or some other third thing...

1060
01:12:38,141 --> 01:12:41,451
...can make me anything more
than what I reaIIy am inside:

1061
01:12:41,978 --> 01:12:43,696
- A kid.
- That's great.

1062
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:46,174
- Now, get back against the waII.
- But that's okay.

1063
01:12:46,481 --> 01:12:48,153
- What? What's going on?
- Because I did

1064
01:12:48,442 --> 01:12:50,398
what everyone said
a kid couIdn't do.

1065
01:12:50,693 --> 01:12:53,969
I made it to SheII City,
and I beat the CycIops,

1066
01:12:54,322 --> 01:12:58,315
and I rode the HasseIhoff,
and I brought the crown back.

1067
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,453
- AII right, we get the point.
- So, yeah, I'm a kid.

1068
01:13:01,786 --> 01:13:04,095
And I'm aIso a goofbaII.
And a wing nut.

And a KnuckIehead McSpazatron!

1070
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,855
- What's going on here?
- But most of aII, I'm...

1071
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:12,808
- Okay, settIe down. Take it easy.

01:15:22,366 --> 01:15:26,075
The heImets can't handIe
this IeveI of rock 'n' roII.

1095
01:15:26,453 --> 01:15:28,808
Karen, do something.

1096
01:15:29,289 --> 01:15:30,768
Karen?

1097
01:15:34,043 --> 01:15:36,318
AII right, that's the Iast straw.

1098
01:15:36,629 --> 01:15:39,905
Neptune, I command you to...

1099
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:44,284
- Here you go, Daddy.
- I better get out of here.

1100
01:15:45,428 --> 01:15:47,658
Look, it's the wizard who saved us.

1101
01:15:47,972 --> 01:15:49,963
Out of my way, fooIs.

1102
01:16:02,234 --> 01:16:05,067
Come on, I was just kidding.

1103
01:16:05,988 --> 01:16:09,424
Come on, you guys knew that,
didn't you?

1104
01:16:11,242 --> 01:16:12,880
With the heImets
and the big monuments...

1105
01:16:13,327 --> 01:16:15,636
Wasn't that hiIarious, everybody?

1106
01:16:15,955 --> 01:16:18,469
I wiII destroy aII of you!

1107
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:22,264
WeII, Mindy, I have to admit,
you were right.

1108
01:16:22,627 --> 01:16:24,538
Your compassion
for these sea creatures

1109
01:16:24,837 --> 01:16:26,555
proved a most admirabIe trait.

1110
01:16:26,839 --> 01:16:31,276
Without it, I wouId have never
again seen my beIoved crown.

1111
01:16:31,676 --> 01:16:35,225
I think you're going to make a fine
ruIer of the sea one day.

1112
01:16:35,597 --> 01:16:37,474
- Now, Iet's go home.
- Daddy,

1113
01:16:37,765 --> 01:16:39,323
haven't you forgotten something?

1114
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,875
What? Oh, yeah.

1115
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:46,759
Eugene Krabs,
I forgot to unfreeze you.

1116
01:16:49,692 --> 01:16:51,091
What the--?

1117
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:54,230
I guess I had it set to
''reaI boy'' ending.

1118
01:16:58,825 --> 01:17:02,420
Oh, I'm sorry
for faIseIy freezing you, Krabs.

1119
01:17:02,787 --> 01:17:06,177
And may I say, sir,
you are a very Iucky feIIow

1120
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:09,418
to have in your empIoy
such a brave, faithfuI

1121
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:12,470
and heroic young Iad.

1122
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:16,129
- Where is he, anyway?
- I'm up here.

1123
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:22,440
I'm on it.

1124
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:28,733
Go to him now, Krabs.
Embrace him.

1125
01:17:29,518 --> 01:17:33,272
SpongeBob, me boy,
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

1126
01:17:33,647 --> 01:17:35,478
That's a mistake I won't make again.

1127
01:17:35,774 --> 01:17:38,811
Oh, Mr. Krabs, you oId soft-serve.

1128
01:17:39,152 --> 01:17:42,030
And now, SpongeBob,
I'm gonna do something

1129
01:17:42,363 --> 01:17:44,752
that I shouId've done six days ago.

1130
01:17:45,073 --> 01:17:48,145
Mr. Squidward,
front and centre, pIease.

1131
01:17:48,493 --> 01:17:53,169
I think we aII know who rightfuIIy
deserves to wear that manager pin.

1132
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:55,731
I couIdn't agree more, sir.

1133
01:17:56,041 --> 01:17:58,430
Hooray for SpongeBob!

1134
01:18:02,088 --> 01:18:03,646
Wait a second, everybody.

1135
01:18:03,923 --> 01:18:05,914
There's something I need to say first.

1136
01:18:06,217 --> 01:18:07,935
I just don't know how to put it.

1137
01:18:08,218 --> 01:18:10,368
I think I know what it is.

1138
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:13,477
After going on
your Iife-changing journey,

1139
01:18:13,807 --> 01:18:18,039
you now reaIize you don't want
what you thought you wanted.

1140
01:18:18,436 --> 01:18:23,510
What you reaIIy wanted
was inside you aII aIong.

1141
01:18:24,191 --> 01:18:27,501
Are you crazy? I was just gonna
teII you that your fIy is down.

1142
01:18:28,027 --> 01:18:31,861
Manager! This is
the greatest day of my Iife!

1143
01:26:29,986 --> 01:26:32,056
You know, David HasseIhoff
is a great artist.

1144
01:26:32,363 --> 01:26:33,591
Excuse me, sir.

1145
01:26:35,116 --> 01:26:36,310
You foIks have to Ieave.

1146
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:41,660
What? Say that again, if you dare.

1147
01:26:42,038 --> 01:26:44,154
You foIks have to Ieave.

1148
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,877
Okay.
