No, what does "exacerbate" mean?

17
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:44,444
It means to make things worse.

No, I haven't forgotten.

- What?

166
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:32,856
How comes you're allowed to
speak to your dad?

A, he's not my dad, OK? He's my stepdad.

Oooh! How are you doing?

189

- Yeah, I just bought a place.

That's great. Glad somebody made it.
How long's that been now?

193

- Er, it's 3 years ago last week.
- Did you do anything special?

194
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:46,377

Tidying up.

Liz rang about the two of you

Things'll be fine, I promise.

red wine instead of beer!

It's not the same.
You promised things would change.

I was going to give them to the jumble.

What would you say if I told you
that Philip's been quite unkind to me?

You weren't easy to live with.

- Did he tell you that? Motherfucker.

Sorry, Mother... Mum!

Did you know that on several occasions...
he touched me?

648
00:45:32,617 --> 00:45:35,922
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.

to respect my feelings.

You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?

662
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:22,198
- It wasn't as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?

No, it's probably best if we...

Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.

If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.

And that will exacerbate things for all of us.

- This is not about you and me.

This is about survival.

- They know us.

- What makes it so secure?
- It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.

00:53:17,162 --> 00:53:19,293
There's a good boy.

765
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:24,904
- Ed, can you pull over?
- 2 seconds.

766
00:53:27,512 --> 00:53:30,210
- Ah! Ed, please pull over.
- What for?

767
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:33,211
- Just pull over!
- All right.

768
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:40,300
Whoa, momma!

769
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:43,778
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.

770
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:45,997
Stop telling me to chill out!

771
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:50,564
- And everybody is not all right.
- (Liz) What's wrong?

772
00:53:50,651 --> 00:53:53,261
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.

773
00:53:53,304 --> 00:53:55,870
- Where's he gone?
- Mum, he's dead.

774
00:53:56,914 --> 00:53:59,219
No, he isn't.

775
00:53:59,262 --> 00:54:01,264
Get out!

776
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,959
Jesus!

777
00:54:05,003 --> 00:54:08,310
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!

778
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:10,441
(Di) Quick!

779
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:12,788
(Music starts again)

780
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,833
- The child lock!
- Ed!

781
00:54:34,665 --> 00:54:36,840
- Now what?
- We keep moving.

782
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:40,667
- (Liz) How do we get Philip out the car?
- We haven't got time.

783
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:43,494
- We can't leave your dad.
- He's not my dad!

784
00:54:43,538 --> 00:54:45,539
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.

785
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:50,061
- I really think we could...
- That's not your husband in there. OK?

786
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:54,498
It looks like him but there is nothing
of the man you loved in that car.

787
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,760
(Turns music off)

788
00:54:56,803 --> 00:54:58,934
Let's go, shall we?

789
00:54:58,977 --> 00:55:01,327
You're not suggesting we walk?

790
00:55:03,327 --> 00:55:07,547
- Everybody OK?
- (Ed) Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

791
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:10,808
Maybe we should all hold hands,
make a crocodile?

792
00:55:10,851 --> 00:55:12,895
Do you know where we're going?

793
00:55:12,939 --> 00:55:15,419
- David, come on.
- Sorry.

794
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:17,855
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.

795
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,506
Are we close?

796
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,726
We're pretty close.

797
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,685
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.

798
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,641
- Did you contact your folks?
- They're in Antigua.

799
00:55:33,684 --> 00:55:36,686
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.

800
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:39,817
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...

801
00:55:39,861 --> 00:55:42,644
- You said this wasn't about us.
- No, it's not.

802
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:45,603
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...

803
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:51,081
You're not just trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.

804
00:55:51,124 --> 00:55:53,344
(Distant screaming and shouting)

805
00:55:53,387 --> 00:55:56,736
- Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
- OK.

806
00:55:57,823 --> 00:55:59,433
Shaun.

807
00:55:59,476 --> 00:56:00,912
Yvonne.

808
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:03,738
- How's it going?
- Er, surviving.

809
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:06,392
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.

810
00:56:06,436 --> 00:56:08,131
Hey, Yvonne.

811
00:56:08,175 --> 00:56:11,045
Erm...this is my boyfriend, Declan.

812
00:56:11,089 --> 00:56:13,176
Erm...my friends Mark, Maggie,

813
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:16,743
- my mum and my cousin Tom.
- All right.

814
00:56:16,786 --> 00:56:19,308
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.

815
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:22,353
- They've split up, actually.
- Oh, really?

816
00:56:22,397 --> 00:56:24,571
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

817
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,659
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?

818
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:31,227
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
- The pub?

819
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,922
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!

820
00:56:41,794 --> 00:56:43,579
(Both) Hi.

821
00:56:43,621 --> 00:56:45,143
(Both) Hello.

822
00:56:45,187 --> 00:56:46,317
Hi.

823
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,144
(Both) Hello.

824
00:56:48,188 --> 00:56:49,841
(Both) All right.

825
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,929
See? The Winchester's just over there.

826
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:56,408
- Over where?
- Over there.

827
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:59,018
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?

828
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:00,888
What's the matter, David?

829
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,758
Never taken a short cut before?

830
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:23,243
Shaun.

831
00:57:23,287 --> 00:57:26,114
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.

832
00:57:40,118 --> 00:57:44,294
Now, the Winchester
is just over that fence, all right?

833
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:47,598
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?

834
00:57:47,686 --> 00:57:51,339
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yes.
- There's 6 of us.

835
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:53,688
- (Screaming)
- Mum!

836
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:58,472
I'm coming!

837
00:57:58,515 --> 00:58:01,212
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?

838
00:58:01,256 --> 00:58:04,082
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.

839
00:58:06,475 --> 00:58:08,040
Shaun?

840
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,738
Are you all right?

841
00:58:14,216 --> 00:58:16,522
(Footsteps and scuffling)

842
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:33,830
What are you doing?

843
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,007
Shaun!

844
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:42,791
Yes!

845
00:58:44,444 --> 00:58:46,661
No, that's rubbish.

846
00:58:54,142 --> 00:58:56,359
- Ooh!
- Yes!

847
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,449
Feel free to step in any time.

848
00:59:00,492 --> 00:59:03,623
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.

849
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,798
I'm so sorry about that.

850
00:59:07,626 --> 00:59:09,757
Right.

851
00:59:11,061 --> 00:59:15,846
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

852
00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:26,762
- Is it clear?
- No.

853
00:59:26,805 --> 00:59:28,981
- How many?
- Lots.

854
00:59:39,157 --> 00:59:42,202
Oh, well, that is just great.

855
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,464
There are a fair few of them, yes.

856
00:59:44,508 --> 00:59:47,856
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?

857
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,118
This is hardly constructive, David!

858
00:59:50,162 --> 00:59:53,988
- We should have stayed at the flat.
- Why didn't you?

859
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:58,425
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.

860
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:01,860
- Will you stop it?
- We'll get nowhere moaning.

861
01:00:01,948 --> 01:00:04,253
(Low groaning)

862
01:00:10,515 --> 01:00:13,691
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.

863
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,909
Or not.

864
01:00:15,953 --> 01:00:19,693
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

865
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:25,259
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face,
it's vacant with a hint of sadness.

866
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:27,565
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

867
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:29,696
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.

868
01:00:30,696 --> 01:00:33,479
(Groans)

869
01:00:33,523 --> 01:00:37,699
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.

870
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:40,264
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

871
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:43,048
- D-Daffs.
- Uh.

872
01:00:43,092 --> 01:00:45,091
- Come on!
- Urgh.

873
01:00:45,135 --> 01:00:48,571
It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead and you hate it. Go.

874
01:00:48,615 --> 01:00:50,355
Uuurgh.

875
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:53,355
- Much better. Ed.
- I'll do it on the night.

876
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,704
This is the night!

877
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:58,184
- What is that?
- What about yours?

878
01:00:58,227 --> 01:01:01,228
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?

879
01:01:01,272 --> 01:01:02,924
Don't...

880
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:05,622
(Groans)

881
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:07,665
Yeah, that's pretty good.

882
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:13,624
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
1, 2, 3.

883
01:02:07,945 --> 01:02:09,859
Go, go, go, go.

884
01:02:12,121 --> 01:02:14,600
Shit! Get round me, get round me!

885
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:19,124
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

886
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:22,255
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.

887
01:02:22,342 --> 01:02:23,864
- They know.
- Stay in character!

888
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,170
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.

889
01:02:27,214 --> 01:02:29,822
- Break the window.
- We'll be exposed!

890
01:02:29,866 --> 01:02:32,649
- Break the window!
- Is there another way in?

891
01:02:32,693 --> 01:02:34,738
- Yeah, there's...
- (Mobile)

892
01:02:35,738 --> 01:02:38,260
2 seconds. Hey, Noodle.

893
01:02:38,303 --> 01:02:41,044
<i>- 'All right?'
- Yeah, man, I can't talk now.</i>

894
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:43,958
<i>- 'You get anything yet?'
- I got nothing.</i>

895
01:02:44,001 --> 01:02:46,958
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.

896
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:50,873
- Oi! What are you doing?
- What are you doing? You stupid moron.

897
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:53,525
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!.

898
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:57,092
Fuck fucking off!. I've spent an entire life...

899
01:02:57,136 --> 01:03:00,398
Look at me. I've spent my entire life
sticking up for you

900
01:03:00,442 --> 01:03:03,748
and all you ever do is fuck things up
and make me look stupid.

901
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,921
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!

902
01:03:06,965 --> 01:03:08,923
Shaun.

903
01:03:09,008 --> 01:03:10,271
Oh.

904
01:03:17,664 --> 01:03:20,491
You were saying about another way in?

905
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:22,666
Yeah, there's a...

906
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,320
What are you doing?

907
01:03:26,494 --> 01:03:29,755
- (Shaun) No!
- Get inside.

908
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:33,584
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.

909
01:03:33,627 --> 01:03:37,628
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!

910
01:03:37,671 --> 01:03:41,847
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!

911
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:44,935
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.

912
01:03:44,978 --> 01:03:47,979
- Wait till I've gone then get inside.
- Gone where?

913
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:53,850
I won't be long, I promise. Come on,
you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.

914
01:03:53,937 --> 01:03:57,373
Come on, this way, that's it!

915
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:01,331
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

916
01:04:01,374 --> 01:04:04,984
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.

917
01:04:05,028 --> 01:04:07,202
All you can eat!

918
01:04:07,246 --> 01:04:09,333
Shall we go in, then?

919
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:21,077
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.

920
01:04:40,954 --> 01:04:43,736
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
- 17.

921
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:49,390
Either way, we need to think about blocking
up this window. We're totally exposed.

922
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:53,000
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.

923
01:04:54,697 --> 01:04:57,654
- Let's get some lights on.
- David, wait!

924
01:04:59,002 --> 01:05:01,568
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.

925
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:05,047
- We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
- No, of course not.

926
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:09,091
- Do we, David?
- No, of course not, Lizzie.

927
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,137
I'm just being proactive.

928
01:05:11,224 --> 01:05:15,615
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.

929
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:19,314
- You did that, you twat.
- Somebody had to do something!

930
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,315
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody
has to take control of the situation

931
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:27,664
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

932
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:30,881
then perhaps...I should.

933
01:05:30,925 --> 01:05:34,362
- Will Shaun be gone long?
- (Liz) He'll be back soon.

934
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:37,319
- How do you know?
- I don't think he'd leave us.

935
01:05:37,363 --> 01:05:43,626
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man
you binned for being unreliable?

936
01:05:43,669 --> 01:05:48,280
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot
is also an impenetrable fortress.

937
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:51,453
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

938
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:54,108
I could get a round in.

939
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:57,935
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade
the window when he gets back.

940
01:05:58,021 --> 01:06:01,066
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

941
01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:03,328
- What are we going to eat?
- Toasties!

942
01:06:03,371 --> 01:06:06,980
- There's a Breville out back.
- Great. Saved by nibbles.

943
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:09,374
Must be why Shaun took us here
before he left.

944
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:13,548
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?

945
01:06:13,592 --> 01:06:18,681
If he does, do you think his master plan
will be anything more than eating peanuts?

946
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,899
Is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's OK?

947
01:06:21,943 --> 01:06:26,510
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.

948
01:06:26,554 --> 01:06:31,164
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it.

949
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,817
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.

950
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,992
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?

951
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,253
- Hello.
- Right, great, fuck it.

952
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:44,950
We'll have a party
and get completely smashed.

953
01:06:44,993 --> 01:06:48,778
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.

954
01:06:48,822 --> 01:06:52,388
- David!
- We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.

955
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,346
Pickle!

956
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,130
Hello, Mum. You all right?

957
01:07:01,174 --> 01:07:03,261
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

958
01:07:03,304 --> 01:07:05,565
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- No.

959
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:07,871
- Check upstairs?
- It's locked.

960
01:07:07,914 --> 01:07:10,437
- Phones?
- Dead. Same as the power.

961
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,524
- OK...
- Nice of you to join us.

962
01:07:14,568 --> 01:07:17,222
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't l?

963
01:07:22,963 --> 01:07:25,833
How did you lose them?

964
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:31,096
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.

965
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,923
- Well, how did you get in?
- The back door.

966
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:36,445
I tried to tell you
before you smashed the window.

967
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:39,882
But it wasn't me blowing our cover
by arguing with my boyfriend.

968
01:07:39,926 --> 01:07:43,708
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.

969
01:07:43,796 --> 01:07:45,884
Thanks, babe.

970
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:49,406
So, what's the plan, then?

971
01:07:51,928 --> 01:07:54,713
Would anyone like a peanut?

972
01:08:04,107 --> 01:08:06,281
Why don't you do your Clyde?

973
01:08:06,325 --> 01:08:09,369
Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?

974
01:08:09,413 --> 01:08:12,370
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orang-utan.

975
01:08:12,413 --> 01:08:15,155
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.

976
01:08:15,198 --> 01:08:18,024
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on.

977
01:08:18,068 --> 01:08:21,243
- You've built it up too much.
- No, just do it.

978
01:08:21,287 --> 01:08:24,201
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

979
01:08:24,245 --> 01:08:26,809
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.

980
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,984
I'm not a performing monkey.

981
01:08:31,464 --> 01:08:34,813
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.

982
01:08:34,857 --> 01:08:38,814
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.

983
01:08:38,858 --> 01:08:42,728
- What about the lights?
- Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.

984
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:46,599
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.

985
01:08:46,643 --> 01:08:48,991
It's quite simple, David.

986
01:09:16,914 --> 01:09:19,566
- Is that it?
- (Liz) That's it.

987
01:09:30,527 --> 01:09:33,049
(Hammering on the door)

988
01:09:45,837 --> 01:09:49,315
Liz, erm...have you got a quid?

989
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:52,273
Erm...

990
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,882
Yeah.

991
01:10:00,407 --> 01:10:02,711
Never anything on, is there?

992
01:10:07,278 --> 01:10:09,106
What?

993
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:15,195
- I think we might have a bit of a problem.
- What do you mean?

994
01:10:19,151 --> 01:10:23,022
- They followed me.
- I thought you said you gave them the slip.

995
01:10:23,066 --> 01:10:25,458
Yeah.

996
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:30,112
(Whispering) Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet then, won't we?

997
01:10:31,547 --> 01:10:33,591
What?

998
01:10:33,678 --> 01:10:35,373
(Loud jingle on fruit machine)

999
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:37,854
Ed, no!

1000
01:10:37,898 --> 01:10:40,028
Turn it off!.

1001
01:10:48,987 --> 01:10:51,380
(Windows rattling)

1002
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:54,815
(Low groaning)

1003
01:11:11,516 --> 01:11:13,473
Shit!

1004
01:11:13,517 --> 01:11:16,257
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I dunno.

1005

(# Queen: Don't Stop Me Now)

1006
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:23,217
- Who put this on?
- It's on random.

1007
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,521
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.

1008
01:11:26,565 --> 01:11:28,348
- What?!
- The jukebox!

1009
01:11:28,391 --> 01:11:31,088
- Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
- What about the rifle?

1010
01:11:31,132 --> 01:11:33,219
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?

1011
01:11:33,262 --> 01:11:36,743
The flaming spirits
Get a rag in, light it.

1012
01:11:36,787 --> 01:11:39,874
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?

1013
01:11:39,918 --> 01:11:41,875
How about pool?

- I'm a pacifist.

- Apart from David and Ed?
- What was Ed's experience?

- He shot his sister in the leg.
- I think you should do it.

- 29.

- 29 bullets.
- Call them shells.

1063
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:23,319
29 shells. I need someone
to help me reload,

1064
01:14:23,363 --> 01:14:25,886
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

- Was that on a beer mat?
- Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.

1068
01:14:36,933 --> 01:14:38,846
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1069
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,454
(Crashing)

1070
01:14:40,498 --> 01:14:43,674
- They want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.

1071
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:47,414
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

1072
01:14:49,676 --> 01:14:51,981
- Barbara.
- Oh, hello.

1073
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:55,112
- Would you like to come with me?
- That'd be lovely.

1074
01:14:56,547 --> 01:15:01,854
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.

1075
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,984
- Really?
- Yeah.

1076
01:15:04,028 --> 01:15:06,030
- Ah!
- Barbara?

1077
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,030
Are you all right?

1078
01:15:10,074 --> 01:15:11,944
I've got something for you.

1079
01:15:13,032 --> 01:15:16,814
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

1080
01:15:16,858 --> 01:15:20,469
- I'd like you to have it.
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...

1081
01:15:20,513 --> 01:15:23,513
It seems only right.

1082
01:15:37,821 --> 01:15:39,822
I didn't want to say anything.

1083
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:42,085
I thought Shaun would be worried.

1084
01:15:43,911 --> 01:15:45,650
Liz!

1085
01:15:45,694 --> 01:15:47,478
Here they come!

1086
01:15:48,826 --> 01:15:51,088
- Stay behind me!
- There's one!

1087
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:53,610
Sorry, we're closed!

1088
01:15:53,653 --> 01:15:55,959
- The safety!
- That happened to me on stage.

1089
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:58,176
Cock it!

1090
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:07,136
- There!
- Where?

1091
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,180
3 o'clock!

1092
01:16:14,443 --> 01:16:18,095
- Oh! Over there again. Quarter to 12.
- What?

1093
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:20,315
- 11:45!
- Keep it simple!

1094
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:23,315
Top left!

1095
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,665
- Reload.
- I'm on it!

1096
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:29,840
Come on, come on.

1097
01:16:33,275 --> 01:16:35,102
Nice shot.

1098
01:16:35,146 --> 01:16:37,842
OK, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1099
01:16:37,886 --> 01:16:40,060
Ed, take over a sec.

1100
01:16:40,234 --> 01:16:43,540
- What is it? What's wrong?
- (Liz) Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1101
01:16:43,584 --> 01:16:47,671
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1102
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:54,021
- Mum, I don't understand.
- The man in his pyjamas.

1103
01:16:54,108 --> 01:16:57,326
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1104
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:00,457
No, you should've said.

1105
01:17:00,501 --> 01:17:03,677
- Take over a sec.
- What's going on?

1106
01:17:03,721 --> 01:17:06,200
- What's up?
- What the hell's going on?

1107
01:17:06,286 --> 01:17:09,504
- Barbara's hurt!
- Just take over a minute.

1108
01:17:09,547 --> 01:17:11,463
(Ed) Jesus.

1109
01:17:11,506 --> 01:17:13,636
(Di) I know first aid.

1110
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,638
Just hang on. Mum!

1111
01:17:16,681 --> 01:17:19,204
- Mum.
- Is she...?

1112
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:21,552
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.

1113
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:24,770
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

1114
01:17:26,118 --> 01:17:30,033
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1115
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:34,774
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?

1116
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:38,774
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.

1117
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:40,994
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1118
01:17:41,037 --> 01:17:43,429
(Sobbing) Mum. Please don't go.

1119
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:54,954
(Gun cocks)

1120
01:17:54,998 --> 01:17:58,000
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.

1121
01:17:58,043 --> 01:18:00,652
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!

1122
01:18:00,696 --> 01:18:03,088
- She's gonna come back!
- She's not going anywhere.

1123
01:18:03,132 --> 01:18:05,523
- She'll change.
- She's my mum!

1124
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,350
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that.

1125
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:11,742
Move aside. I'm gonna count to 3.

1126
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:13,873
1...

1127
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,396
2...

1128
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,657
3!

1129
01:18:16,701 --> 01:18:19,485
- Don't point that gun at my mum!
- Calm down.

1130
01:18:19,572 --> 01:18:22,093
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1131
01:18:22,137 --> 01:18:24,616
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What's that mean?

1132
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:27,009
- This isn't exactly fair.
- Here.

1133
01:18:27,053 --> 01:18:28,922
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1134
01:18:30,184 --> 01:18:33,098
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

1135
01:18:33,142 --> 01:18:35,011
Tell him to put the gun down!

1136
01:18:35,055 --> 01:18:37,316
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.

1137
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:42,709
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.

1138
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:46,015
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!

1139
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,581
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum.

1140
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:52,364
- She's not...
- You've never thought I was good enough.

1141
01:18:52,408 --> 01:18:55,671
- What?
- We all know you're in love with Liz.

1142
01:18:55,714 --> 01:18:58,192
- That is not true.
- (Shaun) Yes it is!

1143
01:18:58,236 --> 01:19:00,237
- That is not true.
- (Di) Yes it is.

1144
01:19:00,323 --> 01:19:03,021
- What?
- I know you only hung out with me

1145
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:08,065
to get close to Liz and when she knocked
you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.

1146
01:19:08,108 --> 01:19:11,849
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?

1147
01:19:11,893 --> 01:19:15,285
Lizzie, I want you to know
that my feelings for you...

1148
01:19:15,328 --> 01:19:19,504
David! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here.

1149
01:19:19,548 --> 01:19:23,679
- Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
- I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".

1150
01:19:23,723 --> 01:19:26,811
- Christ, she's not dead!
- She's finished.

1151
01:19:26,855 --> 01:19:28,986
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.

1152
01:19:29,029 --> 01:19:31,812
You've gone from
a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.

1153
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:33,683
I'm not a chartered accountant.

1154
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,901
- Well, you look like one.
- Yeah.

1155
01:19:35,944 --> 01:19:38,988
- I'm a lecturer.
- You're a twat.

1156
01:19:39,032 --> 01:19:42,772
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.

1157
01:19:42,816 --> 01:19:45,990
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.

1158
01:19:46,078 --> 01:19:49,992
Please can we just calm the fuck down!

1159
01:19:51,602 --> 01:19:55,212
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...

1160
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:57,560
- Thank you.
- Even if he is being a twat.

1161
01:19:57,604 --> 01:19:59,429
Yep.

1162
01:19:59,473 --> 01:20:02,388
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.

1163
01:20:05,172 --> 01:20:08,781
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you

1164
01:20:08,824 --> 01:20:11,304
but we can't afford to fall apart.

1165
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:15,305
Shaun, babe...

1166
01:20:15,349 --> 01:20:18,393
I know you don't wanna hear this...

1167
01:20:36,746 --> 01:20:38,790
You do it.

1168
01:20:48,752 --> 01:20:50,882
I'm sorry, Mum.

1169
01:20:52,229 --> 01:20:54,622
Do it!

1170
01:21:09,585 --> 01:21:14,150
Well...I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1171
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:22,196
David, no!

1172
01:21:23,067 --> 01:21:24,416
David!

1173
01:21:25,241 --> 01:21:28,025
- Right, I'm leaving.
- What?

1174
01:21:28,068 --> 01:21:31,418
- I'm not staying here.
- David, it's suicide.

1175
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:34,896
- I think you should go.
- We will. We can defend ourselves.

1176
01:21:34,984 --> 01:21:37,419
- What do you mean "we"?
- What do you mean?

1177
01:21:37,463 --> 01:21:41,334
Opening that door now
would be a very silly thing to do.

1178
01:21:41,377 --> 01:21:43,811
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...

1179
01:21:43,855 --> 01:21:46,118
- After where he led us?
- Let me finish!

1180
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:50,293
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.

1181
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:53,120
- Get away from that door this instant!
- But...

1182
01:21:53,206 --> 01:21:55,078
David!

1183
01:22:02,558 --> 01:22:04,688
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1184
01:22:04,732 --> 01:22:08,821
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.

1185
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:13,301
Shaun...

1186
01:22:16,476 --> 01:22:18,390
(Crash)

1187
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:20,389
David! No!

1188
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:22,738
No! No! No!

1189
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:26,522
David!

1190
01:22:27,045 --> 01:22:29,263
- No! No!
- David!

1191
01:22:50,181 --> 01:22:52,313
David!

1192
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,706
Dianne, no!

1193
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,358
I'm coming, David!

1194
01:22:59,663 --> 01:23:02,143
David!

1195
01:23:02,187 --> 01:23:04,056
Oh dear.

1196
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,318
- Cocktails?
- Do it.

1197
01:23:17,235 --> 01:23:18,974
Stay back!

1198
01:23:24,151 --> 01:23:25,977
Shaun, hold them!

1199
01:23:29,151 --> 01:23:30,979
Heads!

1200
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:36,806
- Ed!
- Hurry up!

1201
01:23:38,591 --> 01:23:40,982
Shauny, look who it is.

1202
01:23:41,068 --> 01:23:43,635
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1203
01:23:45,201 --> 01:23:46,853
Ed!

1204
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:48,854
- Shaun!
- Ed!

1205
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:50,898
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!

1206
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:52,769
I can't hold them!

1207
01:23:56,378 --> 01:23:57,813
No!

1208
01:24:01,902 --> 01:24:03,685
- Shaun!
- Pete!

1209
01:24:05,859 --> 01:24:07,773
I said leave him alone!

1210
01:24:10,904 --> 01:24:13,905
Ed. Ed!

1211
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:17,037
Shaun, bar!

1212
01:24:28,128 --> 01:24:29,998
Ed!

1213
01:24:30,868 --> 01:24:32,782
Ed!

1214
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:36,043
Ed!

1215
01:24:36,086 --> 01:24:38,001
What?

1216
01:24:38,088 --> 01:24:40,306
Chuck us a cloth, will you?

1217
01:24:53,484 --> 01:24:56,007
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.

1218
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,572
Oh, fuck.

1219
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,878
Ow!

1220
01:25:00,922 --> 01:25:02,531
Fuck it!

1221
01:25:02,574 --> 01:25:05,488
What are we gonna do?
