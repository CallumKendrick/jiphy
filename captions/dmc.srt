1
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,126
Will!

2
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,671
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

3
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:32,174
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:36,971
I think It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:40,308
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

6
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:43,894
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

7
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,274
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

8
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:51,861
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

9
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:58,868
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:01,829
In fact, I do. Mr Mercer?

11
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,835
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

12
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:17,470
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- Is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

13
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,972
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

14
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:23,768
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

15
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:27,938
And I have another one
for a Mr James Norrington.

16
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,191
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

17
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:34,111
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,489
I didn't believe that wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

19
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,284
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

20
00:03:40,284 --> 00:03:43,746
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

21
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,666
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

22
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:50,002
The charge is "conspiring to set free

23
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,756
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

24
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:57,677
and condemned to death,
for which the..."

25
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:01,514
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

26
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:07,019
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

27
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:09,146
Captain.

28
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,984
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,945
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:18,197
Yes, I thought you might.

31
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:25,246
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest

32
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:30,209
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

33
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:35,673
Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

34
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:40,344
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

35
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:05,119
Prisoners, come on!

36
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:45,344
Sorry, mate.

37
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:50,641
Mind if we make a little side trip?

38
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,769
I didn't think so.

39
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:03,779
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

40
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:06,032
were overcome.

41
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:10,828
You got what you went in for, then?

42
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:16,375
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

43
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,795
were expecting something
a bit more shiny,

44
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:24,050
with the Isla de Muerta going old pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea and the treasure with it.

45
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,635
And the Royal Navy chasing us
all around the Atlantic.

46
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,555
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.

47
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,353
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

48
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,607
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.

49
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:42,610
Is that how you're all feeling then?

50
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:47,990
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

51
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:50,493
Walk the plank.

52
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:53,579
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

53
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,999
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

54
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:08,678
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

55
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,975
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

56
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:18,104
It is a drawing of a key.

57
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:26,362
Gentlemen,

58
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,322
what do keys do?

59
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,200
Keys

60
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:33,744
unlock things?

61
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:37,581
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

62
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:40,960
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

63
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,628
No.

64
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:47,091
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.

65
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:51,095
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

66
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:55,641
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

67
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:58,019
So we're going after this key.

68
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:01,397
You're not making any sense at all.

69
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,941
Any more questions?

70
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:06,527
So do we have a heading?

71
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:09,697
A heading.

72
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,242
Set sail in a

73
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:16,120
general

74
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,793
that-way direction.

75
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,045
Captain?

76
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,966
Come on, snap to and make sail.
You know how this works. Go on.

77
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,764
Have you noticed lately

78
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:39,477
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

79
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,271
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

80
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:45,483
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

81
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:49,362
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

82
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:06,212
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

83
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:08,631
Those cuffs won't be necessary.

84
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:17,139
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

85
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:23,104
We wish for you to act as our agent

86
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:27,483
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

87
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:29,944
More acquaintance than friend.
How do you know him?

88
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:32,947
We've had dealings in the past.

89
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:37,535
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

90
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:39,870
What mark did he leave on you?

91
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:46,335
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

92
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:48,421
I would like you to go to him

93
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:53,134
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

94
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:56,053
Recover. At the point of a sword?

95
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:58,556
Bargain.

96
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,981
Letters of marque.

97
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,860
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

98
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,114
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

99
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:20,703
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

100
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,872
Freedom.

101
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:27,126
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

102
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:29,086
The world is shrinking,

103
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,590
the blank edges of the map filled in.

104
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:36,552
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

105
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:39,513
Not unlike you, Mr Turner.

106
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:42,475
You and your fiancee
face the hangman's noose.

107
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,813
- So you get both Jack and the Black Pearl.
- The Black Pearl?

108
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,151
- The property you want that he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

109
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:56,322
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

110
00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:00,034
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

111
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:02,745
A compass?

112
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,914
You know it.

113
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:10,586
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

114
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:38,531
Why is the rum always gone?

115
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:49,625
That's why.

116
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,550
As you were, gents.

117
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,628
Time's run out, Jack.

118
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:55,816
Bootstrap.

119
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:57,985
Bill Turner.

120
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:05,201
You look good, Jack.

121
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:14,210
Is this a dream?

122
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,628
No.

123
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:19,382
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

124
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:29,600
You got the Pearl back, I see.

125
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:34,188
I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way.

126
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,733
Your son.

127
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,444
William?

128
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:43,572
He ended up a pirate after all.

129
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:48,369
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

130
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,663
He sent me.

131
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,625
Davy Jones.

132
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,338
So it's you, then.

133
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:04,302
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?

134
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,345
I chose it.

135
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:11,434
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

136
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,770
I stood up for you.

137
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:17,732
Everything went wrong after that.

138
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,363
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

139
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:27,366
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

140
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:29,994
Unable to move.

141
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,331
Unable to die, Jack.

142
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:38,878
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

143
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,839
I would trade anything for it.

144
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:47,053
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

145
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,847
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

146
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:52,558
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.

147
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:54,769
13 years, you've been her captain.

148
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,729
- Technically...
- Jack.

149
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:59,231
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

150
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,151
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

151
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:06,447
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

152
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,033
The Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...

153
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:11,494
Then it's the locker for you!

154
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:14,705
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

155
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:19,210
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.

156
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:24,674
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

157
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,551
I already told you, Jack.

158
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,847
Your time is up.

159
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:34,725
It comes now,

160
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:40,106
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

161
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,535
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

162
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,954
On deck! Scurry!

163
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:59,542
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

164
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:03,379
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

165
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:08,009
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

166
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:11,429
- Do we have a heading?
- Run! Land.

167
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,313
- Which port?
- I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

168
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,905
- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- No, no!

169
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:32,241
Leave it!

170
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:35,202
Run.

171
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:39,165
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!

172
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:49,467
Jack?

173
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:55,014
For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?

174
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:56,849
Nothing.

175
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:14,510
- Here, now, you can't be here.
- I think you'll find he can.

176
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:16,012
Mr Swann!

177
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:18,180
Governor Swann, still.

178
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:21,475
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

179
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,229
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

180
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:29,442
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

181
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,153
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

182
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:35,865
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

183
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:38,409
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

184
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:40,786
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

185
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:44,832
does not mean that
he would do the same for anyone else.

186
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:48,377
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

187
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:52,465
I have faith in you.

188
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:55,134
Both of you.

189
00:19:56,636 --> 00:19:59,388
Where will you find him?

190
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:04,226
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.

191
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:08,022
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

192
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:11,442
- Properly?
- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

193
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:16,614
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

194
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:27,458
- I'll wait for you.
- Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

195
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,136
Captain Jack Sparrow?

196
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,642
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

197
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:48,604
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

198
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:52,984
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

199
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:55,069
Jack Sparrow?

200
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:57,279
I haven't seen him in a month.

201
00:20:57,446 --> 00:21:01,200
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

202
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:04,745
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

203
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:07,498
but there's an island
just south of the straits

204
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:10,418
where I trade spice for

205
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,545
delicious long pork.

206
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:18,342
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

207
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:20,720
A ship with black sails.

208
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:30,146
My brother will take you ashore.

209
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:43,868
- What's wrong? The beach is right there.
- C'est trop dangereux.

210
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:47,413
- What?
- C'est trop dangereux. Je vous I'avais dit.

211
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,916
Bon voyage. Monsieur.

212
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:18,486
Jack!

213
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:20,529
Jack Sparrow!

214
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:28,412
Marty!

215
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:30,998
Cotton!

216
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,959
Anybody?

217
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:41,968
A familiar face.

218
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:43,844
Don't eat me.

219
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:46,931
- I'm not going to eat you.
- Don't eat me.

220
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:49,475
No. Don't eat me.

221
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:02,571
Gibbs.

222
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,770
Come on! Let's go!

223
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:39,734
Come on! Who wants it?

224
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:44,947
I can do this all day!

225
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,721
Jack?

226
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:53,307
Jack Sparrow!

227
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,977
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.

228
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:06,654
Jack, it's me.

229
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:08,155
Will Turner.

230
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:16,998
Tell them to let me down!

231
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,127
...eensy-weensy.

232
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:29,260
...eunuchy. Snip, snip.

233
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,389
Eunuchy.

234
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:38,686
Jack, the compass.
That's all I need.

235
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:41,856
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for trying to help you.

236
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:44,317
She faces the gallows!

237
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:53,659
Savvy?

238
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:02,376
Save me.

239
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:04,628
Jack, what did you tell them?

240
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:06,756
No!

241
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:09,508
What about Elizabeth?

242
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:11,052
Jack!

243
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,223
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.

244
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:20,645
- We don't bite.
- Go on. We won't bite you.

245
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,733
Come quickly.

246
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,236
- Tell me what's happening.
- Our name still has some standing to the king.

247
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:32,531
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.

248
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,784
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

249
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:36,869
We cannot count on William Turner.

250
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:40,122
- Come!
- He's better man than you give him credit for.

251
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:43,626
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only

252
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,003
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

253
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,838
Even if Will succeeds,

254
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:54,053
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

255
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:58,599
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

256
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:03,771
- A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
- Then there is nothing left for you here.

257
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:13,072
Wait inside.

258
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,200
Captain?

259
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:20,538
Captain.

260
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:28,671
Evening, Governor.

261
00:27:28,754 --> 00:27:30,756
Shame, that.

262
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:33,092
He was carrying this.

263
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:35,845
It's a letter to the king.

264
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:38,306
- It's from you.
- No...

265
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,728
Elizabeth.

266
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,023
What are you doing?

267
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,278
- Where is she?
- Who?

268
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:14,091
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

269
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,427
as your father believes.

270
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:19,972
Then what is?

271
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:23,309
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

272
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:28,564
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

273
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:31,984
- I'm here to negotiate.
- I'm listening.

274
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,781
I'm listening intently.

275
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:41,077
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

276
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:45,873
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

277
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,626
Or else I would not still be here.

278
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:52,838
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

279
00:28:52,838 --> 00:28:56,592
- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.

280
00:28:56,676 --> 00:29:01,430
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

281
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:05,851
- There is something you need to know.
- I see.

282
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:09,063
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

283
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:12,316
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

284
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:15,444
But you mustn't worry.

285
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,448
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

286
00:29:19,448 --> 00:29:22,076
My desires are not so provincial.

287
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:26,956
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

288
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:32,253
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

289
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:39,635
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

290
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,804
So I did.

291
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:46,183
A marriage interrupted

292
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:51,188
or fate intervenes?

293
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:55,109
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

294
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,820
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Really?

295
00:29:57,987 --> 00:30:00,656
To ensure Mr Turner's freedom, then,

296
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:04,285
I'll still want that compass.

297
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:07,997
Consider that in your calculations.

298
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,603
When I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

299
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,439
And I say it was me being clever.

300
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,234
Ain't that right, poochie?

301
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:41,614
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?

302
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:43,866
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

303
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:49,121
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

304
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:53,918
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

305
00:30:54,043 --> 00:30:57,755
- You know you can't read.
- It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

306
00:30:57,838 --> 00:31:03,386
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...

307
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:06,847
Look.

308
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,058
There it is.

309
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,690
What's got into him?

310
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,858
Must have seen a catfish.

311
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,368
Stupid mongrel!

312
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,261
Come on!

313
00:31:52,268 --> 00:31:56,439
- It's ours for the taking.
- Tide's coming in. That should help.

314
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,400
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

315
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,402
There's the truth of it!

316
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:11,912
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

317
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,207
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

318
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:17,918
Amen to that.

319
00:32:34,143 --> 00:32:36,228
Thank you.

320
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:56,332
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

321
00:32:56,415 --> 00:32:58,834
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

322
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:02,630
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

323
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,758
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

324
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:12,515
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

325
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:18,604
and they intend to do him the honour
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

326
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,735
They'll roast him and eat him.

327
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:27,530
Where's the rest of the crew?

328
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:32,243
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

329
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,789
The feast is about to begin.

330
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,542
Jack's life will end

331
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,003
when the drums stop.

332
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:46,340
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?

333
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,387
No, no. Oi! No, no.

334
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,640
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

335
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,726
I am Chief. Want big fire.

336
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:59,103
Come on.

337
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,775
Tout de suite.
Come on. More wood.

338
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,304
Bugger.

339
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,358
A little seasoning, eh?

340
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,623
Well done.

341
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:25,333
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

342
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:30,546
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

343
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:33,466
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

344
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:35,801
About six would do.

345
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,265
Oh, dear.

346
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:47,355
- Hurry!
- Come on!

347
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:53,569
Come on! Is that all you got?

348
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,663
Wait. Stop.

349
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:06,207
Stop.

350
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,972
- What are they doing?
- Stop.

351
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,480
Snake!

352
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:48,708
Move!

353
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:17,194
Well, go on, go get them.

354
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,869
No, no. Oi! No, no!

355
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:28,956
Not good.

356
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:47,433
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

357
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:08,162
Roll the cage!

358
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:10,665
Come on!

359
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:40,194
- Lift the cage! Hurry!
- Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.

360
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:37,710
Run!

361
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,310
This way, lads!

362
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:18,250
Take cover!

363
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:21,003
Stop it!

364
00:42:16,058 --> 00:42:17,601
Bugger.

365
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,798
Haul loose the mooring line!

366
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,134
The mooring line!

367
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,846
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

368
00:42:53,846 --> 00:42:57,224
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

369
00:42:57,725 --> 00:42:59,977
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

370
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,522
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

371
00:43:03,522 --> 00:43:06,108
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

372
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:09,070
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

373
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:11,405
I won't leave without him.

374
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:23,501
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

375
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:34,136
Make ready to cast off!

376
00:43:38,975 --> 00:43:41,268
Good doggy.

377
00:43:56,784 --> 00:44:02,999
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day that you almost...

378
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:08,254
Captain Jack Sparrow.

379
00:44:34,113 --> 00:44:37,116
Let's what some distance between us and this island
and head out to open sea.

380
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,787
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but only in
so far as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.

381
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:43,998
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

382
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:47,209
I have every faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills Master Gibbs.

383
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:50,421
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

384
00:44:56,052 --> 00:44:58,304
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

385
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:01,349
Have you considered keeping her or watch her
or maybe just locking her up somewhere?

386
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:03,934
She is locked up in the prison,
bound to hang for helping you.

387
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,981
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

388
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:12,735
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

389
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:15,446
I must trade it for her freedom.

390
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:20,284
- Mr Gibbs.
- Captain.

391
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,371
We have a need to travel upriver.

392
00:45:23,537 --> 00:45:26,958
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

393
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:30,836
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

394
00:45:31,003 --> 00:45:34,840
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

395
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,678
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

396
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:40,638
William,

397
00:45:40,763 --> 00:45:42,807
I shall trade you the compass

398
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:44,725
if you will help me

399
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,978
to find this.

400
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:53,150
- You want me to find this?
- No.

401
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,737
You want you to find this,

402
00:45:56,821 --> 00:46:00,950
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

403
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:07,665
and or locating in your discovering a detecting way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

404
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:10,668
Savvy?

405
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,672
This is going to save Elizabeth?

406
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:19,969
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

407
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:23,889
Not much.

408
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:26,934
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

409
00:46:53,336 --> 00:46:55,963
What's all this?

410
00:46:56,505 --> 00:47:01,510
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

411
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:04,847
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

412
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:07,725
Is it, now? And you?

413
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:11,896
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

414
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:14,649
All the men, they can feel it.

415
00:47:14,774 --> 00:47:18,402
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

416
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,946
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

417
00:47:20,946 --> 00:47:23,616
A virgin too, likely as not.

418
00:47:23,658 --> 00:47:25,951
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

419
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:30,331
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

420
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:33,292
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

421
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:37,380
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then just get it back to her.

422
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:39,840
Enough! Enough!

423
00:47:39,882 --> 00:47:44,220
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

424
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,390
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

425
00:47:47,556 --> 00:47:49,725
A young woman, by the look of it.

426
00:47:49,725 --> 00:47:52,436
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

427
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,314
Oh, and she's probably naked.

428
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,763
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

429
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:30,308
Well, if you believe such things,

430
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:33,519
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones

431
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:38,274
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

432
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:41,902
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

433
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:45,781
The kraken.

434
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:51,871
They say the stench of its breath is like...

435
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,499
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

436
00:48:55,666 --> 00:49:01,547
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odour of a thousand rotting corpses.

437
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,968
If you believe such things.

438
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:08,846
And the key will spare him that?

439
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:12,391
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

440
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,019
Bad enough even to go visit

441
00:49:15,978 --> 00:49:18,105
her.

442
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,024
Her?

443
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:22,109
Aye.

444
00:49:57,061 --> 00:50:00,856
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

445
00:50:00,982 --> 00:50:04,860
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

446
00:50:04,944 --> 00:50:07,279
Were. Have been.

447
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:09,532
Before.

448
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:12,576
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

449
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:15,162
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

450
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,582
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

451
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:19,959
Mind the boat.

452
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:23,004
Mind the boat.

453
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,102
Jack Sparrow.

454
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:40,271
Tia Dalma.

455
00:50:41,063 --> 00:50:45,526
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

456
00:50:50,323 --> 00:50:52,199
You...

457
00:50:54,744 --> 00:50:57,288
You have a touch of

458
00:50:57,371 --> 00:51:00,750
destiny about you,

459
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,835
William Turner.

460
00:51:04,503 --> 00:51:06,714
You know me?

461
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,342
You want to know me.

462
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:14,096
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

463
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:17,850
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

464
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:20,102
- Come.
- Come.

465
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:28,361
What service may I do you?

466
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:32,990
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment.

467
00:51:36,577 --> 00:51:38,537
Look.

468
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:42,208
An undead monkey.

469
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:44,418
Top that.

470
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:52,259
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

471
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,221
The payment is fair.

472
00:51:55,262 --> 00:51:57,306
We're looking for this.

473
00:51:59,934 --> 00:52:02,687
And what it goes to.

474
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:08,901
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

475
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:12,446
Maybe. Why?

476
00:52:14,782 --> 00:52:19,287
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

477
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:22,164
Or do you know,

478
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:26,252
but are loath to claim it as your own?

479
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:29,880
Your key go to a chest.

480
00:52:30,506 --> 00:52:35,094
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

481
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:38,097
- What is inside?
- Gold?

482
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:42,226
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

483
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:45,604
Nothing bad, I hope?

484
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:49,191
You know of Davy Jones,

485
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:50,776
yes?

486
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,738
A man of the sea.

487
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:56,032
A great sailor,

488
00:52:56,115 --> 00:53:01,078
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

489
00:53:01,203 --> 00:53:04,206
What vexes all men?

490
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,252
What indeed?

491
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:10,713
- The sea.
- Sums.

492
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,841
The dichotomy of good and evil.

493
00:53:14,508 --> 00:53:16,177
A woman.

494
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:18,220
A woman.

495
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:20,348
He fell in love.

496
00:53:20,514 --> 00:53:23,476
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

497
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:27,313
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

498
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,857
See, it was a woman

499
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,735
as changing and harsh

500
00:53:32,735 --> 00:53:36,155
and untamable as the sea.

501
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,783
Him never stopped loving her.

502
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:43,537
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

503
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,290
but not enough to cause him to die.

504
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:52,588
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

505
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,632
Him heart.

506
00:53:54,715 --> 00:53:56,801
Literally or figuratively?

507
00:53:56,842 --> 00:54:01,430
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

508
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:03,599
Could he?

509
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:09,730
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

510
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,565
And so

511
00:54:11,565 --> 00:54:14,235
him carve out him heart,

512
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:19,573
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

513
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,576
The key

514
00:54:22,618 --> 00:54:27,039
he keep with him at all times.

515
00:54:27,623 --> 00:54:31,377
- You knew this.
- I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

516
00:54:31,544 --> 00:54:35,756
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

517
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:38,592
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

518
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:41,512
Let me see your hand.

519
00:54:55,192 --> 00:54:57,653
The black spot!

520
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:02,241
- The black spot!
- Black spot!

521
00:55:02,616 --> 00:55:05,745
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

522
00:55:05,745 --> 00:55:09,290
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

523
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:16,172
My little beauty, where are you?

524
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:19,842
Such a long time in such a mess.

525
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:24,805
Davy Jones cannot make port.

526
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:28,225
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

527
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:31,979
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

528
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:34,607
and so you will carry land with you.

529
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:45,868
Dirt.

530
00:55:46,994 --> 00:55:50,623
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

531
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:55,836
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

532
00:55:55,878 --> 00:55:58,798
If you don't want it, give it back.

533
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:02,593
- No.
- Then it helps.

534
00:56:04,804 --> 00:56:09,850
It seems we have a need to find
the Flying Dutchman.

535
00:56:12,979 --> 00:56:16,774
A touch of destiny.

536
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:34,792
That's the Flying Dutchman?

537
00:56:36,711 --> 00:56:39,463
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

538
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:41,924
Do not underestimate her.

539
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:47,722
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

540
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:51,392
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

541
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:53,811
And if there are crewmen?

542
00:56:53,853 --> 00:56:56,105
I cut down anyone in my path.

543
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:59,900
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

544
00:57:00,026 --> 00:57:02,987
Your chariot awaits you, Sire.

545
00:57:07,617 --> 00:57:13,205
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

546
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:17,209
- It might save your life.
- Bon voyage!

547
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:23,716
Douse the lamps.

548
00:58:05,424 --> 00:58:06,509
Sailor.

549
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,220
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

550
00:58:09,261 --> 00:58:11,681
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

551
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:14,475
There's no use.
You've run aground.

552
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:15,977
No.

553
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:18,145
Beneath us.

554
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:21,482
Foul breath.

555
00:59:13,951 --> 00:59:16,871
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

556
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:35,765
Get back! Get back!

557
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,008
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

558
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:31,320
Do you fear death?

559
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:37,576
Do you fear that dark abyss?

560
01:00:39,328 --> 01:00:42,206
All your deeds laid bare.

561
01:00:43,082 --> 01:00:46,127
All your sins punished.

562
01:00:47,962 --> 01:00:50,381
I can offer you

563
01:00:50,548 --> 01:00:53,050
an escape.

564
01:00:53,134 --> 01:00:56,220
Don't listen to him!

565
01:01:04,812 --> 01:01:07,857
Do you not fear death?

566
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:12,820
I'll take my chances, sir.

567
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:15,364
To the depths.

568
01:01:20,828 --> 01:01:22,830
Cruel blackguard!

569
01:01:22,997 --> 01:01:25,124
Life is cruel.

570
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,836
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

571
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:32,465
I offer you a choice.

572
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:35,259
Join my crew

573
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:37,803
and postpone the judgment.

574
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,558
One hundred years before the mast.

575
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,937
Will ye serve?

576
01:01:48,648 --> 01:01:50,691
I will serve.

577
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:03,579
You are neither dead nor dying.

578
01:02:03,704 --> 01:02:06,374
What is your purpose here?

579
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:12,254
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

580
01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:16,634
What is your purpose here?

581
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:19,887
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

582
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:25,476
Did he, now?

583
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:29,063
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

584
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:48,708
You have a debt to pay.

585
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:52,253
You've been captain of the Black Pearl
for 13 years.

586
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:54,422
That was our agreement.

587
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,342
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.

588
01:02:58,426 --> 01:03:02,179
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

589
01:03:02,305 --> 01:03:05,558
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

590
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:08,227
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

591
01:03:11,147 --> 01:03:14,150
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.

592
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:16,777
One soul is not equal to another.

593
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:24,160
So we've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

594
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:26,787
Price?

595
01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:32,335
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

596
01:03:36,088 --> 01:03:38,674
One hundred souls.

597
01:03:39,675 --> 01:03:41,385
Three days.

598
01:03:41,844 --> 01:03:45,765
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

599
01:03:45,806 --> 01:03:49,018
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

600
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:51,729
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

601
01:03:54,815 --> 01:03:56,859
Have you not met Will Turner?

602
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:59,695
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

603
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,239
Worth at least four.

604
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:04,617
Maybe three and a half.

605
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,245
And did I happen to mention

606
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:10,915
he's in love?

607
01:04:11,707 --> 01:04:14,293
With a girl.

608
01:04:14,377 --> 01:04:16,879
Due to be married.

609
01:04:16,879 --> 01:04:18,965
Betrothed.

610
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:24,428
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

611
01:04:24,595 --> 01:04:29,433
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony. Eh?

612
01:04:33,396 --> 01:04:38,359
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

613
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:41,153
But I wonder, Sparrow,

614
01:04:41,237 --> 01:04:43,447
can you live with this?

615
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:48,077
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

616
01:04:48,077 --> 01:04:52,999
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

617
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:58,296
Yep. I'm good with it.

618
01:04:58,296 --> 01:05:01,549
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean ink.

619
01:05:05,886 --> 01:05:08,514
Three days.

620
01:05:13,144 --> 01:05:15,271
Three days.

621
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:25,740
- Mr Gibbs.
- Aye.

622
01:05:25,906 --> 01:05:28,534
I feel sullied and unusual.

623
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:34,332
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

624
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:40,588
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

625
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:42,632
Tortuga.

626
01:05:43,716 --> 01:05:45,092
Tortuga.

627
01:05:49,138 --> 01:05:52,808
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

628
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:56,062
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

629
01:05:56,062 --> 01:06:00,524
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

630
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:05,154
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

631
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:07,740
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

632
01:06:07,907 --> 01:06:13,329
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

633
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:16,040
Sir!

634
01:06:39,188 --> 01:06:41,816
She wants you to do something.

635
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:47,530
She's trying to give a sign.

636
01:06:55,955 --> 01:06:58,457
Over there! Look for a sign!

637
01:07:03,212 --> 01:07:05,464
Look, there! There it is!

638
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,467
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

639
01:07:08,467 --> 01:07:11,595
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

640
01:07:11,721 --> 01:07:16,726
- That would be a bad sign.
- What's that over there?

641
01:07:34,952 --> 01:07:38,205
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

642
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:40,625
I've never sailed a day in me life.

643
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,836
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

644
01:07:44,003 --> 01:07:47,298
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

645
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:50,134
My wife ran off with my dog

646
01:07:50,551 --> 01:07:53,095
and I'm drunk for a month

647
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:55,222
and I don't give an ass rat's

648
01:07:55,222 --> 01:07:57,308
if I live or die.

649
01:07:57,308 --> 01:08:00,353
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want. I know what I want...

650
01:08:00,436 --> 01:08:04,607
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's nest for you.

651
01:08:04,607 --> 01:08:06,734
- I know what I want.
- Next!

652
01:08:06,942 --> 01:08:12,573
Ever since I was a little lad,
I've always wanted to sail the seas forever.

653
01:08:12,573 --> 01:08:15,326
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

654
01:08:15,326 --> 01:08:17,662
Thanks very much.

655
01:08:17,662 --> 01:08:22,833
- How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us four.

656
01:08:26,379 --> 01:08:28,631
And what's your story?

657
01:08:28,673 --> 01:08:31,175
My story.

658
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:36,347
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

659
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:40,017
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

660
01:08:40,059 --> 01:08:43,020
The pursuit cost me my crew,

661
01:08:43,104 --> 01:08:45,731
my commission,

662
01:08:45,898 --> 01:08:47,900
and my life.

663
01:08:53,072 --> 01:08:57,868
- Commodore?
- No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

664
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:03,374
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

665
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:08,754
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

666
01:09:08,754 --> 01:09:10,172
Lord.

667
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:12,258
You didn't try to sail through it?

668
01:09:12,466 --> 01:09:14,885
So, do I make your crew

669
01:09:15,011 --> 01:09:17,013
or not?

670
01:09:17,888 --> 01:09:20,599
You haven't said where you're going.

671
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:22,810
Somewhere nice?!

672
01:09:23,936 --> 01:09:26,230
So, am I worthy to serve

673
01:09:26,314 --> 01:09:29,150
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

674
01:09:31,527 --> 01:09:35,031
Or should I just kill you now?

675
01:09:41,078 --> 01:09:43,205
You're hired.

676
01:09:43,331 --> 01:09:47,335
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

677
01:09:47,376 --> 01:09:51,047
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

678
01:10:04,185 --> 01:10:06,145
- Time to go.
- Aye!

679
01:10:50,856 --> 01:10:52,817
Thanks, mate.

680
01:10:58,572 --> 01:11:00,449
Carry on.

681
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:10,293
Come on, then! Who wants some?

682
01:11:10,376 --> 01:11:13,879
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

683
01:11:13,963 --> 01:11:16,257
Come on, who's first?

684
01:11:18,968 --> 01:11:22,430
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

685
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:51,834
James Norrington.

686
01:11:52,668 --> 01:11:55,796
What has the world done to you?

687
01:12:23,908 --> 01:12:26,243
Heave!

688
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:28,663
Heave!

689
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,332
Heave!

690
01:12:31,582 --> 01:12:33,501
Heave!

691
01:12:34,502 --> 01:12:38,005
- Heave!
- Heave!

692
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,929
Secure the mast tackle, Mr Turner!

693
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:50,017
Set to it!

694
01:12:55,356 --> 01:12:58,192
- Step aside.
- Hey! Mind yourself!

695
01:12:58,776 --> 01:13:01,112
Let go, boy!

696
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:05,950
No.

697
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:16,460
Haul that weevil to his feet.

698
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:25,511
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!

699
01:13:25,594 --> 01:13:30,766
- No!
- Impeding me in my duties?

700
01:13:30,766 --> 01:13:34,687
- You'll share the punishment.
- I'll take it all.

701
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:37,106
Will you, now?

702
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:42,486
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

703
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,034
My son.

704
01:13:52,997 --> 01:13:55,249
He's my son.

705
01:14:06,552 --> 01:14:09,930
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

706
01:14:09,972 --> 01:14:13,893
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

707
01:14:18,773 --> 01:14:21,317
No. No, I won't!

708
01:14:21,442 --> 01:14:24,111
The cat's out of the bag, Mr Turner.

709
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:30,034
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

710
01:14:33,871 --> 01:14:36,207
No.

711
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:38,292
- Bosun!
- No!

712
01:15:22,586 --> 01:15:25,923
You had it easy, boy!

713
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:28,968
- Will.
- I don't need your help.

714
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:37,059
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh
from bone, with every swing.

715
01:15:37,143 --> 01:15:42,189
So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?

716
01:15:42,231 --> 01:15:44,317
Yes.

717
01:15:50,364 --> 01:15:56,203
100 years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,

718
01:15:56,329 --> 01:16:00,166
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.

719
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:06,047
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

720
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:09,175
Not until your debt is paid.

721
01:16:09,258 --> 01:16:11,677
I've sworn no oath.

722
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:15,598
Then you must get away.

723
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:18,768
Not until I find this.

724
01:16:20,353 --> 01:16:22,313
The key.

725
01:16:29,487 --> 01:16:32,031
The dead man's chest.

726
01:16:33,115 --> 01:16:35,242
What do you know of this?

727
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:39,997
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

728
01:16:40,122 --> 01:16:43,167
No, don't stab the heart.

729
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:48,381
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

730
01:16:48,506 --> 01:16:52,718
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

731
01:16:53,177 --> 01:16:55,721
So the captain has the key?

732
01:16:56,973 --> 01:16:59,767
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

733
01:17:00,142 --> 01:17:02,937
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

734
01:17:06,273 --> 01:17:07,942
Captain Sparrow!

735
01:17:07,942 --> 01:17:10,528
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

736
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:13,281
I'm here to find the man I love.

737
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,786
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

738
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:24,000
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

739
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,459
Elizabeth.

740
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:28,004
Hide the rum.

741
01:17:28,004 --> 01:17:31,007
You know these clothes do not flatter you at all.
It should be a dress or nothing.

742
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:34,176
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

743
01:17:36,387 --> 01:17:39,557
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

744
01:17:39,724 --> 01:17:43,269
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but

745
01:17:43,269 --> 01:17:50,234
through unfortunate entirely unforcibly circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

746
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:55,114
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

747
01:17:56,157 --> 01:17:57,992
Davy Jones?

748
01:17:59,493 --> 01:18:01,829
Oh, please.

749
01:18:02,913 --> 01:18:05,291
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?

750
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:08,836
- You look very awful. What are you doing here?
- You hired me.

751
01:18:08,919 --> 01:18:11,130
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

752
01:18:11,213 --> 01:18:14,133
- You smell funny.
- Jack!

753
01:18:14,467 --> 01:18:17,261
All I want is to find Will.

754
01:18:20,723 --> 01:18:25,227
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?

755
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:28,522
Of course.

756
01:18:28,522 --> 01:18:32,818
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

757
01:18:33,444 --> 01:18:37,406
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well,

758
01:18:37,448 --> 01:18:40,534
- there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.

759
01:18:40,785 --> 01:18:43,037
A chest of unknown size and origin.

760
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,000
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

761
01:18:49,502 --> 01:18:51,337
And whoever possesses that chest

762
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:55,341
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

763
01:18:55,424 --> 01:19:00,346
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

764
01:19:00,429 --> 01:19:04,016
You don't actually believe him, do you?

765
01:19:08,854 --> 01:19:11,148
How would we find it?

766
01:19:13,234 --> 01:19:15,152
With this.

767
01:19:15,278 --> 01:19:18,197
My compass is unique.

768
01:19:18,698 --> 01:19:21,909
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken".

769
01:19:22,868 --> 01:19:27,415
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

770
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:32,336
Where does it point?

771
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:37,258
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

772
01:19:40,344 --> 01:19:42,054
Jack.

773
01:19:43,848 --> 01:19:47,685
- Are you telling the truth?
- Every word, love.

774
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:50,229
And what you want most in this world

775
01:19:51,063 --> 01:19:56,027
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

776
01:19:56,027 --> 01:20:01,115
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

777
01:20:16,672 --> 01:20:18,966
- Mr Gibbs!
- Cap'n.

778
01:20:19,133 --> 01:20:21,302
- We have our heading.
- Finally!

779
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:25,973
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

780
01:20:26,057 --> 01:20:28,017
Miss Swann.

781
01:20:30,269 --> 01:20:33,731
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

782
01:20:40,446 --> 01:20:45,284
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it. Don't you agree?

783
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:47,995
I assure you, these are not necessary.

784
01:20:47,995 --> 01:20:52,583
I had you brought here I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

785
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:56,128
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on the arm of Tortuga,

786
01:20:56,212 --> 01:21:00,174
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

787
01:21:00,299 --> 01:21:03,177
and other fugitives from justice.

788
01:21:03,344 --> 01:21:05,137
"Justice"? Hardly.

789
01:21:05,179 --> 01:21:11,018
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

790
01:21:11,435 --> 01:21:16,274
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

791
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:20,236
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

792
01:21:20,444 --> 01:21:26,492
I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.

793
01:21:29,662 --> 01:21:31,539
What do you want from me?

794
01:21:31,706 --> 01:21:34,792
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

795
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:38,546
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

796
01:21:39,505 --> 01:21:42,049
To you, you mean.

797
01:21:45,678 --> 01:21:48,472
Shall I remove these shackles?

798
01:21:51,559 --> 01:21:55,062
Do what you can for my daughter.

799
01:22:01,277 --> 01:22:06,365
So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

800
01:22:06,365 --> 01:22:10,286
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

801
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:19,045
I wager ten years.

802
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,256
I'll match ten years.

803
01:22:23,257 --> 01:22:24,884
Agreed.

804
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,723
Wondering how it's played?

805
01:22:30,765 --> 01:22:32,683
- I understand.
- Liar!

806
01:22:32,808 --> 01:22:38,272
It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.

807
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:41,776
- What are they wagering?
- The only thing we have.

808
01:22:41,943 --> 01:22:44,278
Years of service.

809
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:50,534
- So any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

810
01:22:53,412 --> 01:22:56,248
I challenge Davy Jones.

811
01:23:15,768 --> 01:23:18,771
I accept, mate.

812
01:23:30,408 --> 01:23:35,913
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

813
01:23:36,038 --> 01:23:38,165
No!

814
01:23:40,293 --> 01:23:41,919
Against?

815
01:23:43,379 --> 01:23:45,423
I want this.

816
01:23:57,476 --> 01:24:02,481
- How do you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

817
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:08,237
You can still walk away.

818
01:24:33,054 --> 01:24:36,140
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

819
01:24:36,182 --> 01:24:39,101
No! Don't do this.

820
01:24:40,936 --> 01:24:43,731
The die is cast.

821
01:24:43,814 --> 01:24:46,901
I bid three twos.

822
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:49,153
It's your bid, Captain.

823
01:24:55,451 --> 01:24:58,371
Four fours.

824
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:10,758
Four fives.

825
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,510
Six threes.

826
01:25:22,103 --> 01:25:25,273
Seven fives.

827
01:25:49,213 --> 01:25:51,507
Eight fives.

828
01:25:56,262 --> 01:25:59,682
Welcome to the crew, lad.

829
01:26:01,934 --> 01:26:04,854
Twelve fives.

830
01:26:05,146 --> 01:26:06,856
Twelve fives.

831
01:26:06,981 --> 01:26:09,734
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

832
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:14,572
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

833
01:26:18,117 --> 01:26:22,997
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

834
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:29,170
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore

835
01:26:30,421 --> 01:26:33,549
the very next time we make port!

836
01:26:41,223 --> 01:26:44,685
Fool. Why did you do that?

837
01:26:46,228 --> 01:26:48,564
I couldn't let you lose.

838
01:26:48,564 --> 01:26:51,275
It was never about winning or losing.

839
01:26:53,778 --> 01:26:55,071
The key.

840
01:26:56,864 --> 01:26:59,700
You just wanted to know where it was.

841
01:27:19,303 --> 01:27:21,973
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

842
01:27:25,893 --> 01:27:27,979
Captain's orders.

843
01:29:17,755 --> 01:29:20,299
Here. Take this, too.

844
01:29:21,342 --> 01:29:24,720
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

845
01:29:25,137 --> 01:29:28,432
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

846
01:29:28,516 --> 01:29:31,519
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

847
01:29:36,232 --> 01:29:40,111
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

848
01:29:40,152 --> 01:29:46,242
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

849
01:29:47,243 --> 01:29:51,539
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

850
01:29:53,249 --> 01:29:55,960
You owe me nothing, Will.

851
01:29:56,043 --> 01:29:58,254
Now go.

852
01:29:59,338 --> 01:30:02,008
They'll know you helped me.

853
01:30:03,384 --> 01:30:05,428
What more can they do to me?

854
01:30:11,267 --> 01:30:13,561
I take this with a promise.

855
01:30:13,644 --> 01:30:16,022
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

856
01:30:16,105 --> 01:30:19,942
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

857
01:30:21,485 --> 01:30:23,779
I will not abandon you.

858
01:30:26,532 --> 01:30:29,035
I promise.

859
01:30:43,132 --> 01:30:45,301
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

860
01:30:45,301 --> 01:30:49,388
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

861
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:53,309
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

862
01:30:53,601 --> 01:30:57,480
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

863
01:30:57,521 --> 01:31:00,107
Of course.

864
01:31:00,107 --> 01:31:03,903
- He wants the chest.
- Yes, he did say something about a chest.

865
01:31:03,986 --> 01:31:07,615
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

866
01:31:07,698 --> 01:31:11,494
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

867
01:31:11,577 --> 01:31:15,164
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

868
01:31:15,247 --> 01:31:18,584
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

869
01:31:18,626 --> 01:31:20,753
Brace the foreyard!

870
01:31:20,878 --> 01:31:24,048
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

871
01:31:24,048 --> 01:31:26,092
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

872
01:31:26,133 --> 01:31:27,760
Decidedly not.

873
01:31:27,843 --> 01:31:33,391
Will strikes a deal for this and uphold it on that,
yet you were the one standing with the prize, full pardon.

874
01:31:33,474 --> 01:31:35,810
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

875
01:31:35,977 --> 01:31:38,688
and the East India Trading Company."

876
01:31:38,729 --> 01:31:41,065
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

877
01:31:41,148 --> 01:31:43,693
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

878
01:31:43,693 --> 01:31:46,070
Persuade me.

879
01:31:46,153 --> 01:31:49,865
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

880
01:31:52,285 --> 01:31:56,038
As I said, persuade me.

881
01:32:10,219 --> 01:32:12,763
It's a curious thing.

882
01:32:13,848 --> 01:32:19,520
There was a time I would have give anything to you
to look like that while thinking about me.

883
01:32:19,604 --> 01:32:21,981
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

884
01:32:22,023 --> 01:32:24,859
Don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

885
01:32:29,488 --> 01:32:31,782
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancee

886
01:32:31,949 --> 01:32:35,953
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?

887
01:33:00,478 --> 01:33:03,856
Strange thing to come upon a longboat
so far out in open water.

888
01:33:03,856 --> 01:33:07,234
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

889
01:33:07,234 --> 01:33:10,404
And what are we running from?

890
01:33:15,284 --> 01:33:18,037
That dress. Where did you get it?

891
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:19,747
It was found aboard the ship.

892
01:33:19,914 --> 01:33:24,335
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

893
01:33:24,335 --> 01:33:27,922
- That's foolish.
- Yes. Exceedingly foolish.

894
01:33:28,047 --> 01:33:34,011
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

895
01:33:34,136 --> 01:33:36,180
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

896
01:33:36,222 --> 01:33:39,350
Off the books, of course.

897
01:33:39,433 --> 01:33:43,145
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

898
01:33:43,229 --> 01:33:46,148
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

899
01:33:46,274 --> 01:33:49,110
- Colours?
- She isn't flying any.

900
01:33:49,193 --> 01:33:51,028
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

901
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:06,127
You will watch this.

902
01:34:13,342 --> 01:34:16,262
Let no joyful voice be heard!

903
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:21,726
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

904
01:34:23,894 --> 01:34:29,692
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake

905
01:34:31,193 --> 01:34:33,279
the kraken.

906
01:34:33,738 --> 01:34:35,448
No!

907
01:34:52,256 --> 01:34:54,884
I've doomed us all.

908
01:34:55,134 --> 01:34:58,179
It's the Flying Dutchman!

909
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,519
Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

910
01:35:05,603 --> 01:35:08,147
Must have hit a reef.

911
01:35:15,821 --> 01:35:18,824
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

912
01:35:18,908 --> 01:35:22,370
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

913
01:35:29,585 --> 01:35:33,130
- Kraken!
- Kraken!

914
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,605
Here it is! Take it!

915
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,649
Take it!

916
01:38:03,572 --> 01:38:08,077
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

917
01:38:08,202 --> 01:38:10,663
I am the sea.

918
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:17,670
You need time alone with your thoughts.

919
01:38:17,753 --> 01:38:20,298
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

920
01:38:25,803 --> 01:38:29,098
There are no survivors.

921
01:38:49,368 --> 01:38:53,205
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

922
01:38:53,372 --> 01:38:56,042
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.

923
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:57,835
"First"?

924
01:38:58,002 --> 01:39:01,255
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

925
01:39:01,297 --> 01:39:03,341
Who told him of the key?

926
01:39:06,427 --> 01:39:08,554
Jack Sparrow.

927
01:39:26,906 --> 01:39:33,704
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

928
01:39:33,829 --> 01:39:37,249
I just thought I'd be married by now.

929
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:39,627
I'm so ready to be married.

930
01:39:47,176 --> 01:39:49,220
You know...

931
01:39:50,805 --> 01:39:56,269
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

932
01:39:56,310 --> 01:40:04,735
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact
perform a "marr-i-age" right here.

933
01:40:04,902 --> 01:40:07,280
Right on this deck.

934
01:40:07,446 --> 01:40:09,323
Right now.

935
01:40:12,994 --> 01:40:15,246
No, thank you.

936
01:40:15,329 --> 01:40:16,914
Why not?

937
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:20,793
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

938
01:40:20,835 --> 01:40:25,298
Except for a sense of honour
and decency and a moral centre.

939
01:40:25,631 --> 01:40:28,175
And personal hygiene.

940
01:40:29,552 --> 01:40:31,846
Trifles.

941
01:40:31,929 --> 01:40:34,557
You will come over to my side. I know it.

942
01:40:34,557 --> 01:40:39,854
- You seem very certain.
- One word, love. Curiosity.

943
01:40:39,937 --> 01:40:41,647
You long for freedom.

944
01:40:41,647 --> 01:40:44,775
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

945
01:40:44,775 --> 01:40:47,903
To act on selfish impulse.

946
01:40:47,903 --> 01:40:50,698
You want to see what it's like.

947
01:40:50,823 --> 01:40:55,202
One day, you won't be able to resist.

948
01:40:55,745 --> 01:40:58,331
Why doesn't your compass work?

949
01:40:59,999 --> 01:41:03,127
My compass works fine.

950
01:41:03,586 --> 01:41:05,379
Because you and I are alike,

951
01:41:05,463 --> 01:41:08,758
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

952
01:41:08,799 --> 01:41:12,053
- To do the right thing.
- I love those moments.

953
01:41:12,553 --> 01:41:14,889
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

954
01:41:15,056 --> 01:41:20,478
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

955
01:41:20,603 --> 01:41:23,773
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

956
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,484
That you're a good man.

957
01:41:26,525 --> 01:41:29,028
All evidence to the contrary.

958
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:32,198
I have faith in you.

959
01:41:32,281 --> 01:41:35,201
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

960
01:41:36,869 --> 01:41:39,830
Curiosity.

961
01:41:40,039 --> 01:41:42,959
You're going to want it.

962
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,921
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

963
01:41:48,381 --> 01:41:50,549
You won't be able to resist.

964
01:41:51,926 --> 01:41:57,139
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

965
01:41:59,642 --> 01:42:02,603
I do want to know what it tastes like.

966
01:42:02,687 --> 01:42:04,480
But, seeing as you're a good man,

967
01:42:04,522 --> 01:42:08,985
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honour.

968
01:42:17,285 --> 01:42:19,453
I'm proud of you, Jack.

969
01:42:19,495 --> 01:42:22,290
Land, ho!

970
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:29,297
I want my jar of dirt.

971
01:42:30,756 --> 01:42:33,718
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

972
01:42:33,801 --> 01:42:38,973
- We don't want the kraken to catch us.
- I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

973
01:42:39,015 --> 01:42:43,519
And I don't think it's "kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "krayken".

974
01:42:43,561 --> 01:42:45,104
With a long a?

975
01:42:45,229 --> 01:42:49,025
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian,

976
01:42:49,191 --> 01:42:50,901
and "kracken" is closer to that.

977
01:42:51,068 --> 01:42:54,530
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

978
01:42:54,614 --> 01:42:57,241
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

979
01:43:01,078 --> 01:43:03,331
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

980
01:43:03,414 --> 01:43:05,750
Don't touch my dirt.

981
01:43:41,702 --> 01:43:46,874
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

982
01:43:51,087 --> 01:43:54,382
Yes, it does. You're sitting on it.

983
01:43:55,216 --> 01:43:57,093
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

984
01:44:04,725 --> 01:44:07,561
- "Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
- I could join the circus.

985
01:44:07,561 --> 01:44:09,397
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

986
01:44:13,651 --> 01:44:18,364
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

987
01:44:18,531 --> 01:44:20,449
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

988
01:44:20,616 --> 01:44:23,911
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

989
01:44:25,579 --> 01:44:28,499
- Down, then!
- Down!

990
01:45:38,235 --> 01:45:40,321
It's real.

991
01:45:41,238 --> 01:45:43,324
You actually were telling the truth.

992
01:45:43,407 --> 01:45:46,911
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

993
01:45:47,036 --> 01:45:49,872
With good reason!

994
01:45:49,997 --> 01:45:52,416
Will!

995
01:45:52,583 --> 01:45:56,379
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

996
01:46:02,426 --> 01:46:04,512
How did you get here?

997
01:46:04,553 --> 01:46:08,557
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

998
01:46:08,683 --> 01:46:10,476
Not so easy, is it?

999
01:46:10,643 --> 01:46:13,229
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1000
01:46:13,354 --> 01:46:17,483
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1001
01:46:17,566 --> 01:46:19,652
- What?
- What?

1002
01:46:20,236 --> 01:46:23,364
...I was reunited with my father.

1003
01:46:23,447 --> 01:46:25,741
Well, you're welcome, then.

1004
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,996
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1005
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:31,622
Pretty much.

1006
01:46:31,706 --> 01:46:34,083
Time and tide, love.

1007
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:36,335
Oi! What are you doing?

1008
01:46:37,378 --> 01:46:39,797
I'm gonna to kill Jones.

1009
01:46:40,756 --> 01:46:43,175
Can't let you do that, William.

1010
01:46:43,175 --> 01:46:49,348
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

1011
01:46:55,354 --> 01:46:58,649
Now, if you please.

1012
01:46:59,275 --> 01:47:01,861
The key.

1013
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:06,824
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1014
01:47:06,824 --> 01:47:10,119
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

1015
01:47:10,244 --> 01:47:13,873
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

1016
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,501
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1017
01:47:18,294 --> 01:47:22,256
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

1018
01:47:22,423 --> 01:47:25,593
I deliver it, I get my life back.

1019
01:47:27,136 --> 01:47:28,679
The dark side of ambition.

1020
01:47:28,804 --> 01:47:32,516
I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

1021
01:47:36,854 --> 01:47:38,397
Stop it!

1022
01:47:45,071 --> 01:47:46,656
Will!

1023
01:47:47,573 --> 01:47:50,701
- Guard the chest!
- No!

1024
01:47:50,826 --> 01:47:56,457
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

1025
01:47:56,499 --> 01:48:01,337
Fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

1026
01:48:01,337 --> 01:48:04,006
That will solve everything! I've had it!

1027
01:48:04,131 --> 01:48:09,136
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1028
01:48:11,722 --> 01:48:16,936
- How'd this go all screwy?
- Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

1029
01:48:17,061 --> 01:48:20,147
Mr Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honour,

1030
01:48:20,231 --> 01:48:22,775
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

1031
01:48:22,817 --> 01:48:26,988
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

1032
01:48:27,071 --> 01:48:30,658
'twixt him and his twice-cursed
pirate father.

1033
01:48:30,783 --> 01:48:32,702
- Sad.
- This is madness!

1034
01:48:32,868 --> 01:48:36,664
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

1035
01:48:36,706 --> 01:48:38,666
Terrible temptation.

1036
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:44,672
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

1037
01:48:50,344 --> 01:48:52,221
Enough!

1038
01:48:58,603 --> 01:49:01,063
The heat!

1039
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:22,293
Bugger!

1040
01:49:34,513 --> 01:49:36,891
By your leave, Mr Turner.

1041
01:50:23,813 --> 01:50:26,983
By your leave, Mr Norrington.

1042
01:51:19,035 --> 01:51:22,038
Do excuse me
while I kill the man who ruined my life.

1043
01:51:22,038 --> 01:51:26,167
- Be my guest.
- Let us examine that claim for a moment.

1044
01:51:26,584 --> 01:51:31,964
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

1045
01:51:32,131 --> 01:51:38,930
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

1046
01:51:40,097 --> 01:51:42,642
So whose fault is it, really,

1047
01:51:42,725 --> 01:51:47,063
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

1048
01:51:47,229 --> 01:51:49,148
Enough!

1049
01:51:51,442 --> 01:51:55,237
Unfortunately, Mr Turner, he's right!

1050
01:51:57,323 --> 01:51:59,158
Still rooting for you, mate.

1051
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:00,136
We got it! We got it! We got it!

1052
01:53:14,483 --> 01:53:17,570
Hello, poppet.

1053
01:53:44,305 --> 01:53:46,307
Come on, run!

1054
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:31,060
- Sword!
- Sword! Sword!

1055
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:36,565
Sword!

1056
01:55:17,273 --> 01:55:19,942
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.

1057
01:55:19,984 --> 01:55:22,236
To the left... no, turn around.

1058
01:55:22,278 --> 01:55:24,405
Go to the right.

1059
01:55:24,447 --> 01:55:27,033
No, that's a tree.

1060
01:55:27,116 --> 01:55:28,576
Shut it.

1061
01:56:18,167 --> 01:56:20,544
Jar of dirt!

1062
01:57:20,563 --> 01:57:22,607
Right.

1063
01:57:55,765 --> 01:57:58,059
We've got it!

1064
01:58:07,693 --> 01:58:10,696
Come on, Turner!

1065
01:58:26,879 --> 01:58:31,550
Leave him lie! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

1066
01:58:31,968 --> 01:58:34,679
- We're not getting out of this.
- Not with the chest.

1067
01:58:34,679 --> 01:58:36,681
Into the boat.

1068
01:58:36,764 --> 01:58:39,684
- You're mad!
- Don't wait for me.

1069
01:58:45,815 --> 01:58:49,568
- I say we respect his final wish.
- Aye!

1070
01:58:58,953 --> 01:59:01,414
Your bravery is wasted.

1071
01:59:02,748 --> 01:59:09,171
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

1072
01:59:11,090 --> 01:59:12,842
Here you go!

1073
01:59:24,729 --> 01:59:26,480
Pirates!

1074
01:59:44,415 --> 01:59:47,960
- What happened to the chest?
- Norrington took it to draw them off.

1075
01:59:48,377 --> 01:59:51,672
- You're pulling too hard!
- You ain't pulling hard enough!

1076
01:59:52,089 --> 01:59:55,176
- Where's the commodore?
- Fell behind.

1077
01:59:55,176 --> 01:59:57,428
My prayers be with him.

1078
01:59:57,470 --> 01:59:59,472
Best not wallow in our grief.

1079
01:59:59,639 --> 02:00:04,435
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.

1080
02:00:19,784 --> 02:00:22,119
Lord on high, deliver us.

1081
02:00:25,289 --> 02:00:27,166
I'll handle this, mate.

1082
02:00:29,418 --> 02:00:31,045
Oi, fishface!

1083
02:00:32,546 --> 02:00:35,132
Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!

1084
02:00:40,471 --> 02:00:42,431
Got it!

1085
02:00:43,641 --> 02:00:46,686
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

1086
02:00:46,769 --> 02:00:48,271
Look what I got.

1087
02:00:48,312 --> 02:00:51,357
I got a jar of dirt.
I got a jar of dirt

1088
02:00:51,565 --> 02:00:53,442
And guess what's inside it?

1089
02:00:54,277 --> 02:00:55,820
Enough!

1090
02:01:03,869 --> 02:01:06,622
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard!

1091
02:01:06,789 --> 02:01:09,917
Brace up the foreyard!

1092
02:01:13,045 --> 02:01:15,089
Hard to starboard!

1093
02:01:15,131 --> 02:01:20,052
Send his beloved Pearl
back to the depths.

1094
02:01:32,148 --> 02:01:36,068
She's on us! She's on us!

1095
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:41,699
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, Captain.

1096
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:09,143
Make fast!

1097
02:02:10,353 --> 02:02:12,897
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

1098
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:15,733
Come on, girl!

1099
02:02:21,781 --> 02:02:24,200
- She's falling behind!
- Aye. We've got her!

1100
02:02:24,241 --> 02:02:27,995
We're the faster? Against the wind,
the Dutchman beats us that's what she takes her break.

1101
02:02:28,162 --> 02:02:30,456
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1102
02:02:30,498 --> 02:02:32,458
Aye.

1103
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:36,003
We're out of range!

1104
02:02:36,128 --> 02:02:40,716
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

1105
02:02:40,841 --> 02:02:43,261
We're giving up, sir?

1106
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:55,606
They're giving up!

1107
02:03:01,779 --> 02:03:03,823
My father is on that ship.

1108
02:03:03,906 --> 02:03:06,450
If we can outrun them we can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1109
02:03:06,534 --> 02:03:13,416
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

1110
02:03:23,509 --> 02:03:26,304
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

1111
02:03:27,722 --> 02:03:30,683
We must have hit a reef!

1112
02:03:32,768 --> 02:03:36,814
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

1113
02:03:36,897 --> 02:03:39,900
- What is it?
- The kraken.

1114
02:03:40,276 --> 02:03:42,570
- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

1115
02:03:42,612 --> 02:03:47,033
It'll attack the starboard, I've seen it before. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

1116
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:23,110
Easy, boys!

1117
02:04:26,572 --> 02:04:27,615
Will?

1118
02:04:28,115 --> 02:04:30,326
Steady! Steady.

1119
02:04:32,203 --> 02:04:35,748
- Will!
- Hold. Hold.

1120
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:38,709
I think we've held fire long enough.

1121
02:04:39,961 --> 02:04:42,338
- Will!
- Fire!

1122
02:05:02,483 --> 02:05:06,070
- It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
- There's no boats.

1123
02:05:14,161 --> 02:05:18,833
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

1124
02:05:21,168 --> 02:05:25,631
- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

1125
02:05:39,812 --> 02:05:43,941
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

1126
02:05:44,984 --> 02:05:47,069
Hurry up!

1127
02:05:47,153 --> 02:05:50,740
- There's only half of kegs of powder!
- Then load the rum.

1128
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:02,418
Aye, the rum too!

1129
02:06:30,696 --> 02:06:32,698
Step to!

1130
02:06:36,369 --> 02:06:38,871
You coward.

1131
02:06:43,709 --> 02:06:45,711
Not good.

1132
02:06:53,678 --> 02:06:56,430
- Haul away!
- Heave!

1133
02:06:56,472 --> 02:07:00,810
- Heave like you're being paid for it!
- Put your backs into it!

1134
02:07:43,894 --> 02:07:47,189
- I got you! I got you!
- Don't let me go!

1135
02:07:47,189 --> 02:07:49,942
- I won't let you go!
- Shoot me!

1136
02:07:55,323 --> 02:07:58,284
- Clear?
- Higher! Higher!

1137
02:08:15,092 --> 02:08:17,136
Here! Come on!

1138
02:08:17,887 --> 02:08:20,556
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1139
02:08:20,598 --> 02:08:22,683
Come on!

1140
02:08:47,583 --> 02:08:50,795
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

1141
02:10:18,132 --> 02:10:20,092
Did we kill it?

1142
02:10:20,176 --> 02:10:23,804
No. We just made it angry.

1143
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:27,141
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

1144
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:31,687
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1145
02:10:34,065 --> 02:10:36,901
Jack. The Pearl.

1146
02:10:38,194 --> 02:10:40,529
She's only a ship, mate.

1147
02:10:40,613 --> 02:10:43,240
He's right.
We have to head for land.

1148
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:46,369
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

1149
02:10:46,369 --> 02:10:50,998
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.

1150
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,794
Abandon ship.

1151
02:10:54,919 --> 02:10:57,255
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1152
02:11:13,938 --> 02:11:16,148
Thank you, Jack.

1153
02:11:18,234 --> 02:11:21,070
We're not free yet, love.

1154
02:11:21,153 --> 02:11:23,281
You came back.

1155
02:11:25,908 --> 02:11:28,452
I always knew you were a good man.

1156
02:11:41,507 --> 02:11:44,302
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

1157
02:11:44,385 --> 02:11:46,804
Come on, Will. Step to!

1158
02:12:06,032 --> 02:12:08,451
It's after you, not the ship.

1159
02:12:08,534 --> 02:12:11,495
It's not us.

1160
02:12:11,537 --> 02:12:14,332
This is the only way, don't you see?

1161
02:12:17,543 --> 02:12:19,712
I'm not sorry.

1162
02:12:25,343 --> 02:12:27,345
Pirate.

1163
02:12:46,697 --> 02:12:48,908
Where's Jack?

1164
02:12:52,536 --> 02:12:56,499
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

1165
02:13:05,132 --> 02:13:07,009
Go!

1166
02:13:19,772 --> 02:13:22,108
Bugger. Bugger, bugger.

1167
02:13:51,387 --> 02:13:53,556
Come on!

1168
02:13:57,852 --> 02:14:00,605
Just got it. Come on.

1169
02:14:29,675 --> 02:14:32,136
Not so bad.

1170
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:45,274
Hello, beastie.

1171
02:15:34,073 --> 02:15:38,244
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1172
02:15:39,578 --> 02:15:41,872
The captain goes down with his ship.

1173
02:15:41,872 --> 02:15:45,918
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

1174
02:15:51,299 --> 02:15:53,801
Open the chest.

1175
02:15:55,011 --> 02:15:57,471
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1176
02:16:13,029 --> 02:16:19,201
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1177
02:16:24,957 --> 02:16:27,585
The last of our ships is returned.

1178
02:16:27,752 --> 02:16:30,129
Is there any news on the chest?

1179
02:16:30,171 --> 02:16:35,968
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1180
02:16:35,968 --> 02:16:38,095
He had these.

1181
02:16:45,186 --> 02:16:48,314
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

1182
02:16:55,821 --> 02:16:59,909
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

1183
02:16:59,951 --> 02:17:02,536
Do you have the compass?

1184
02:17:02,662 --> 02:17:04,497
Better.

1185
02:17:11,796 --> 02:17:14,298
The heart of Davy Jones.

1186
02:18:09,729 --> 02:18:12,189
Against the cold

1187
02:18:12,315 --> 02:18:14,650
and the sorrow.

1188
02:18:24,869 --> 02:18:27,371
It's a shame.

1189
02:18:27,455 --> 02:18:29,957
I know you're thinking that with the Pearl

1190
02:18:29,999 --> 02:18:35,421
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1191
02:18:35,421 --> 02:18:38,132
Doesn't matter now.

1192
02:18:38,382 --> 02:18:40,927
The Pearl is gone,

1193
02:18:41,010 --> 02:18:42,970
along with its captain.

1194
02:18:43,054 --> 02:18:45,264
Aye.

1195
02:18:45,431 --> 02:18:49,268
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

1196
02:18:49,352 --> 02:18:52,480
He fooled us all right till the end,

1197
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:56,359
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

1198
02:18:59,236 --> 02:19:00,988
To Jack Sparrow.

1199
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:06,077
- Never another like Captain Jack.
- He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1200
02:19:06,577 --> 02:19:08,704
He was a good man.

1201
02:19:29,433 --> 02:19:33,437
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1202
02:19:34,855 --> 02:19:38,609
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it?

1203
02:19:39,902 --> 02:19:42,238
What would you...

1204
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:49,537
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

1205
02:19:50,663 --> 02:19:54,625
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

1206
02:19:54,667 --> 02:19:59,797
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pearl?

1207
02:20:05,970 --> 02:20:07,221
Aye.

1208
02:20:08,264 --> 02:20:09,557
Aye.

1209
02:20:10,308 --> 02:20:11,434
Aye.

1210
02:20:12,852 --> 02:20:13,894
Aye.

1211
02:20:16,772 --> 02:20:18,858
Yes.

1212
02:20:21,193 --> 02:20:22,403
Aye.

1213
02:20:22,486 --> 02:20:24,447
All right.

1214
02:20:25,489 --> 02:20:32,580
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end,

1215
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:39,921
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

1216
02:20:54,810 --> 02:20:59,023
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?
