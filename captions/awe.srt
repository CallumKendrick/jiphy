00:00:57,918 --> 00:01:02,514
"In order to affect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions

2
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:05,183
and to ensure the common good,

3
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:08,626
a state of emergency is declared
for these territories

4
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:11,323
by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett,

5
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:14,526
duly appointed representative
of His Majesty, the king.

6
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:18,670
By decree, according to martial law,

7
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,197
the following statutes
are temporarily amended:

8
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:24,972
Right to assembly, suspended.

9
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:30,908
Right to habeas corpus, suspended.

10
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:35,580
Right to legal counsel, suspended.

11
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:40,855
Right to verdict by a jury of peers,
suspended.

12
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:47,222
By decree, all persons
found guilty of piracy,

13
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:50,429
or aiding a person convicted of piracy,

14
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:54,440
or associating with a person
convicted of piracy...

15
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,240
...shall be sentenced to
hang by the neck until dead."

A dangerous song to be singing...

51
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:57,411
...for any who are
ignorant of its meaning.

52
00:05:58,018 --> 00:05:59,918
Particularly a woman.

53
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,854
Particularly a woman alone.

54
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:06,819
What makes you think
she's alone?

55
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:12,921
You protect her?

56
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,300
And what makes you think
I need protecting?

57
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:19,001
Your master's expecting us.

58
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:23,441
And an unexpected death'd
cast a slight pall on our meeting.

59
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:26,478
Pick those feet up!

60
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,144
On the double!

61
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:33,382
Eyes front!

62
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:43,856
No, no, no. None.

63
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:14,688
lt always takes me
about a week to get my sea legs.

64
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,922
I was throwing up horribly
the last time.

65
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:31,335
Steady as she goes.

66
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:34,702
All right.

67
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:40,318
Have you heard anything from Will?

68
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:42,719
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts

69
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,225
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.

70
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,819
Is he that terrifying?

71
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:53,832
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

72
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:11,442
We're through. Make ready.

73
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,152
Hurry now.

74
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:29,433
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

75
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:33,796
Well, when you put it that way...

76
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,271
Remove. Please.

77
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,147
Remove. Please.

78
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:13,668
Captain Barbossa,
welcome to Singapore.

79
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,370
More steam.

80
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:42,924
None of that.

81
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:46,961
If things don't go the way we want,
then we're the only chance they've got.

82
00:10:53,246 --> 00:10:57,842
I understand that you have
a request to make of me.

83
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,977
More of a proposal to put to ye.

84
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:06,791
I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

85
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:11,627
Hmm. It's an odd coincidence.

86
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:14,792
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

87
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:17,268
No.

88
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:19,965
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

89
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:23,998
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

90
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:27,170
and tried to make off with these.

91
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:31,511
The navigational charts.

92
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:35,883
The route to the Farthest Gate.

93
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:42,851
Would'nt it be amazing
if this venture of yours

94
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,330
took you to the world beyond this one?

95
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,266
It would strain credulity at that.

96
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:08,015
This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?

97
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:14,260
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.

98
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:15,583
No, no!

99
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:29,407
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.

100
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:33,768
- I assure you I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!

101
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:41,347
You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

102
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:43,753
But I cannot help but wonder...

103
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:46,790
Why?

104
00:12:56,236 --> 00:13:01,970
The song has been sung.
The time is upon us.

105
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:06,241
We must convene the Brethren Court.

106
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:12,273
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honor the call.

107
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:15,313
More steam.

108
00:13:22,295 --> 00:13:23,819
More steam!

109
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:34,429
- There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.

110
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:36,407
It is true.

111
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:39,741
It seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...

112
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:44,782
...is by betraying other pirates.

113
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:47,217
We must put
our differences aside.

114
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:48,345
Wait for the signal.

115
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:51,584
The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

116
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:56,322
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

117
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,192
Against East India
Trading Company,

118
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:01,927
what value is the Brethren Court?

119
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,433
What can any of us do?

120
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:07,337
You can fight!
Get off me!

121
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:10,865
You are Sao Feng,
the pirate lord of Singapore.

122
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:15,643
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

123
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:19,585
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,

124
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:21,916
and those who pass the test
become legend.

125
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:25,353
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?

126
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:28,554
The most notorious pirates
from around the world

127
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:30,619
are uniting against our enemy,

128
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:33,791
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

129
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:41,138
Elizabeth Swann.

130
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:45,371
There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

131
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:50,104
And the eye does not go wanting.

132
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:57,021
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

133
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:01,759
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

134
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:03,022
Jack Sparrow.

135
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,124
He's one of the pirate lords.

136
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:15,497
The only reason...

137
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:20,536
...I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...

138
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:24,580
...is so I can send him back myself!

139
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:33,287
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

140
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:36,817
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

141
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,524
So we must go and get him back.

142
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:48,070
So you admit...

143
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:50,672
...you have deceived me.

144
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,142
Weapons!

145
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:56,542
Weapons.

146
00:15:57,216 --> 00:16:01,209
Sao Feng, I assure you,
our intentions are strictly honorable.

147
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,228
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!

148
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,463
Kill him. He's not our man.

149
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:20,438
If he's not with you,
and he's not with us...

150
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:23,007
...who's he with?

151
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:25,476
Charge!

152
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:47,321
Will!

153
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:04,239
Look out! Look behind you!

154
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,482
Ready!

155
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:11,045
Fire.

156
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:21,856
Chart!

157
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:48,551
Boo!

158
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:57,529
Company! Make ready. Set. Fire!

159
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,499
Company!

160
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,671
Make ready. Set.

161
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:12,811
Fire!

162
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:31,068
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

163
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:36,074
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

164
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:37,575
It is coincidence only.

165
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:45,182
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

166
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,913
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

167
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,019
Why should I expect any better?

168
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:56,960
I need the Black Pearl
to free my father.

169
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:01,860
You're helping me to get it.

170
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,443
Uh-oh.

171
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,250
Fire in the hole.

172
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:38,630
Thank you, Jack.

173
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,797
Thank you, Jack.

174
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,840
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.

175
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:49,243
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

176
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:52,148
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

177
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:54,049
This way. Be quick.

178
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:03,089
Haul the snotters with a will!

179
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:04,857
Keep it taut.

180
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:08,923
Secure provisions
and stow the cargo.

181
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,834
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

182
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:14,804
Do you think he will honor the call?

183
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:17,342
I cannot say.

184
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,474
There's an evil on these seas

185
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:25,882
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

186
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:34,452
A piece of eight.

187
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:36,916
Nine of them, you say.

188
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:40,083
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

189
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,751
Nine pieces of eight.

190
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:44,387
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.

191
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:46,795
Nothing can hold against the armada.

192
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:49,096
Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.

193
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:50,692
Nothing we know of.

194
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:55,404
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

195
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:58,204
He was mum on that, sir.

196
00:21:58,277 --> 00:21:59,744
Hmm.

197
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:02,246
Then he knows the value of information.

198
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:05,112
Better keep this between ourselves.

199
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:08,483
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

200
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:15,089
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

201
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,891
Yes. Something for you there.

202
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,330
Your new station deserves an old friend.

203
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:38,447
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

204
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:40,075
Execution.

205
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,153
The Brethren know they face extinction.

206
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:53,530
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

207
00:23:18,324 --> 00:23:21,521
No one said anything about cold.

208
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:25,360
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

209
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:29,300
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

210
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:33,896
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

211
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:39,473
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

212
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:44,710
to a place not of death, but punishment.

213
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:48,617
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

214
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,284
...stretching on forever.

215
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:55,216
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

216
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,765
Yeah. I knew there was a good reason.

217
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:16,010
Nothing here is set.

218
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:19,377
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

219
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:24,115
No. But it leads to more places.

220
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:31,719
"Over the edge.

221
00:24:31,797 --> 00:24:34,231
Over again."

222
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,764
"Sunrise sets.

223
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:41,829
Flash of green."

224
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:46,701
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

225
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:52,382
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

226
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:57,013
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

227
00:24:57,089 --> 00:25:00,889
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

228
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:04,285
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

229
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:07,196
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

230
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:11,430
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

231
00:25:16,008 --> 00:25:19,603
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

232
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:23,011
It's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.

233
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,013
It's getting back.

234
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:07,660
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

235
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,256
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

236
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:13,559
Aye, aye, sir!

237
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:18,828
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

238
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:22,271
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

239
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:24,709
Fetch the chest.

240
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:27,572
And the governor?

241
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:32,113
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

242
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:34,516
Does he know?

243
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,753
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

244
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:44,012
Step lively, men.

245
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,014
Step lively!

246
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:49,287
Stand fast!

247
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,696
Steady, men.

248
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:09,345
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

249
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:12,383
I will not have it on my ship!

250
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:15,978
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that...
because I will.

251
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:18,955
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

252
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:22,425
that this ship do as directed
by the company.

253
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:30,067
We need prisoners to interrogate,

254
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:33,332
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

255
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:37,307
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.

256
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:41,278
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

257
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:47,978
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

258
00:28:48,954 --> 00:28:52,651
This is no longer your world, Jones.

259
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:56,859
The immaterial has become...

260
00:28:57,996 --> 00:28:59,725
...immaterial.

261
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,926
Charge your bayonets.

262
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:44,307
How long do we continue not talking?

263
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,838
Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.

264
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:55,385
Then we rescue Jack.

265
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:23,876
For what we want most...

266
00:30:25,884 --> 00:30:29,183
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

267
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:45,402
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

268
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:48,933
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

269
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,998
to find a place as can't be found.

270
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,442
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

271
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:56,180
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

272
00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:58,774
To stations!

273
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:01,284
All hands to stations!

274
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:04,117
Huh?

275
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:07,090
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

276
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,994
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

277
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:15,127
Blimey.

278
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:32,514
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

279
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:35,246
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

280
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,154
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

281
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:45,157
Tie her off.

282
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:52,531
Hard aport.

283
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,304
Hold on!

284
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:39,877
Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.

285
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:45,480
Dead men tell no tales.

286
00:33:33,672 --> 00:33:35,105
My peanut.

287
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:38,767
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

288
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:41,142
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

289
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:43,340
Step lively with a will.

290
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:45,007
- Aye, aye.
- Right away, sir.

291
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,778
I want a fire down below!

292
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:53,619
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

293
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:08,403
Haul! Haul!

294
00:34:08,473 --> 00:34:11,340
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.

295
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,206
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

296
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:29,193
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.

297
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:32,691
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

298
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:36,834
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

299
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:40,770
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

300
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,273
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

301
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:46,868
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

302
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:49,213
Shall I?

303
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:56,245
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

304
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,857
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

305
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:06,159
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

306
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,028
Do you understand?

307
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:11,227
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

308
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,967
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

309
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,508
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

310
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:21,068
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

311
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:24,115
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

312
00:35:24,182 --> 00:35:27,083
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

313
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:33,881
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

314
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:45,835
No wind.

315
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,306
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

316
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,409
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

317
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:57,312
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

318
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:12,586
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

319
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:14,359
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

320
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:18,129
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

321
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:32,816
Shoo.

322
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:53,098
A rock.

323
00:37:20,398 --> 00:37:23,959
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

324
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:25,258
Oh.

325
00:37:26,738 --> 00:37:28,296
A rope.

326
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:52,107
This truly is a godforsaken place.

327
00:39:52,884 --> 00:39:55,944
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.

328
00:39:57,288 --> 00:39:58,915
He's here.

329
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,289
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

330
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,793
And does it matter?

331
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:06,922
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

332
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:15,266
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

333
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,438
Impossible.

334
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:04,076
Boat.

335
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:14,363
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.

336
00:41:23,508 --> 00:41:26,204
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

337
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,369
Hide the rum.

338
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,379
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.

339
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:30,812
I thought so.

340
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:33,851
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

341
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:34,907
Sir?

342
00:41:34,986 --> 00:41:39,013
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

343
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,422
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

344
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,058
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.

345
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:52,065
I know that.
I know where I am.

346
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:56,368
- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.

347
00:41:57,075 --> 00:41:58,940
Oh, Hector.

348
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,944
It's been too long. Has'nt it?

349
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:05,813
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

350
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:09,083
No, I didn't.

351
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:11,246
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

352
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:15,224
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

353
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,461
He thinks we're a hallucination.

354
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:21,025
William, tell me something:

355
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:25,126
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

356
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:28,764
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

357
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:30,296
No.

358
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,809
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

359
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:36,870
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

360
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:38,313
Jack.

361
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:42,419
This is real. We're here.

362
00:42:53,398 --> 00:42:56,060
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

363
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:58,799
We've come to rescue you.

364
00:43:00,405 --> 00:43:03,932
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

365
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:07,341
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,

366
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:11,574
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

367
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:15,944
I see my ship. Right there.

368
00:43:19,457 --> 00:43:20,981
Can't spot it.

369
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,392
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.

370
00:43:24,462 --> 00:43:27,260
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

371
00:43:27,331 --> 00:43:30,698
- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.

372
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:33,635
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

373
00:43:33,705 --> 00:43:37,505
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

374
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:40,237
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

375
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:42,108
And you need a crew.

376
00:43:44,215 --> 00:43:46,410
Why should I sail with any of you?

377
00:43:46,484 --> 00:43:49,976
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

378
00:43:53,725 --> 00:43:57,161
Oh, she's not told you.

379
00:43:57,228 --> 00:44:00,061
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

380
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:02,899
As for you...

381
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:10,005
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

382
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:13,034
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

383
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:15,045
Don't need you. You scare me.

384
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:18,981
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...

385
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,711
Cotton.

386
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:25,313
Cottors parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.

387
00:44:26,491 --> 00:44:27,788
Who are you?

388
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:30,157
Tai Huang. These are my men.

389
00:44:30,828 --> 00:44:34,662
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

390
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,762
- I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

391
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:42,863
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

392
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,134
Weigh anchor.

393
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:49,304
Jack...

394
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:54,243
Which way are you going, Jack?

395
00:44:56,387 --> 00:44:59,686
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

396
00:44:59,757 --> 00:45:02,317
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

397
00:45:02,393 --> 00:45:03,826
What are you doing?

398
00:45:03,895 --> 00:45:06,489
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

399
00:45:06,564 --> 00:45:09,328
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

400
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,891
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

401
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:14,130
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

402
00:45:14,705 --> 00:45:17,697
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

403
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:20,266
That makes you "chartman."

404
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:25,247
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

405
00:45:31,088 --> 00:45:34,285
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

406
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:37,293
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

407
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:38,623
Sorry.

408
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,665
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

409
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:22,937
You left Jack to the Kraken.

410
00:46:24,008 --> 00:46:26,135
He's rescued now. It's done with.

411
00:46:29,313 --> 00:46:31,281
Will, I had no choice.

412
00:46:32,516 --> 00:46:34,381
You chose not to tell me.

413
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:37,048
I couldn't.

414
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:39,981
It wasn't your burden to bear.

415
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:42,857
But I did bear it, didn't I?

416
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:46,427
I just didn't know what it was.

417
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:48,858
I thought...

418
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:52,025
You thought I loved him.

419
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:04,378
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

420
00:47:07,385 --> 00:47:08,682
You can't.

421
00:47:37,248 --> 00:47:38,408
Eerie.

422
00:47:40,184 --> 00:47:42,345
That's downright macabre.

423
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:51,555
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

424
00:48:01,472 --> 00:48:03,667
Be disrespectful, it would.

425
00:48:03,741 --> 00:48:07,507
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

426
00:48:09,146 --> 00:48:12,309
That was the duty
him was charged with...

427
00:48:12,616 --> 00:48:15,312
...by the goddess, Calypso.

428
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:20,988
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

429
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:26,263
And every ten years...

430
00:48:27,064 --> 00:48:29,191
...him could come ashore...

431
00:48:30,234 --> 00:48:34,534
...to be with she
who love him... truly.

432
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:41,470
But the man has become a monster.

433
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,106
So he wasn't always... tentacley?

434
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:49,379
No.

435
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:53,989
Him was a man...

436
00:48:54,058 --> 00:48:56,049
...once.

437
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:05,392
Now there's boats coming.

438
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:15,841
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

439
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:19,041
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

440
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:21,380
It's best just let them be.

441
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:38,334
It's my father. We've made it back.

442
00:49:38,402 --> 00:49:40,962
Father! Father, here, look here!

443
00:49:42,773 --> 00:49:43,865
Elizabeth.

444
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,334
We're not back.

445
00:49:54,452 --> 00:49:55,476
Father!

446
00:49:58,756 --> 00:50:02,248
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

447
00:50:03,494 --> 00:50:04,825
No. No.

448
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,525
I think I am.

449
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:09,589
No, you can't be.

450
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:13,601
There was this chest, you see.

451
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:18,034
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

452
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:19,937
Come aboard.

453
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,773
And a heart.

454
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:27,113
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

455
00:50:27,184 --> 00:50:30,711
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

456
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:33,780
The Dutchman must have a captain.

457
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:36,850
Silly thing to die for.

458
00:50:37,228 --> 00:50:40,459
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

459
00:50:42,299 --> 00:50:43,391
Come on.

460
00:50:44,468 --> 00:50:48,700
A touch... of destiny.

461
00:50:51,575 --> 00:50:52,872
Take the line.

462
00:50:55,379 --> 00:50:57,574
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

463
00:50:57,648 --> 00:50:59,377
Father, the line! Take the line!

464
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:05,519
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

465
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:09,855
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!

466
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:12,485
I'll give your love to your mother.

467
00:51:12,563 --> 00:51:15,430
- Please, I won't let you go!
- Elizabeth.

468
00:51:15,499 --> 00:51:17,558
Elizabeth.

469
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:24,936
Is there a way?

470
00:51:29,747 --> 00:51:31,442
Him at peace.

471
00:51:38,856 --> 00:51:40,414
No water.

472
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,652
Why is all but the rum gone?

473
00:51:45,296 --> 00:51:46,729
Rum's gone too.

474
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:59,535
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

475
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:03,512
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

476
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:06,812
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

477
00:52:07,618 --> 00:52:08,710
Forever.

478
00:52:08,786 --> 00:52:12,745
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

479
00:52:13,324 --> 00:52:15,053
Why doesn't he do something?

480
00:52:15,459 --> 00:52:18,326
- Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

481
00:52:18,395 --> 00:52:22,729
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

482
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,764
"Over the edge." Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

483
00:52:28,405 --> 00:52:30,373
Sunrises don't set.

484
00:52:34,878 --> 00:52:36,778
"Up is down."

485
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:39,338
Well, that's just maddeningly un-helpful.

486
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,384
Why are these things never clear?

487
00:52:41,452 --> 00:52:44,285
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

488
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:50,449
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

489
00:52:50,527 --> 00:52:53,690
- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.

490
00:52:53,764 --> 00:52:56,289
That's even more
than less than un-helpful.

491
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:59,131
Sail the seas for eternity.

492
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:02,138
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

493
00:53:02,206 --> 00:53:04,197
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

494
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:09,269
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

495
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,275
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

496
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,808
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

497
00:53:16,887 --> 00:53:19,219
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

498
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,554
But eternity is longer still.

499
00:53:22,293 --> 00:53:25,319
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

500
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:27,395
Or not?

501
00:53:27,464 --> 00:53:31,332
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

502
00:53:31,635 --> 00:53:33,967
Come sunset, it won't matter.

503
00:53:36,774 --> 00:53:38,469
Not sunset.

504
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:42,939
Sundown.

505
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:46,439
And rise. Up.

506
00:53:47,718 --> 00:53:48,912
What's that?

507
00:53:51,722 --> 00:53:54,850
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?

508
00:53:54,925 --> 00:53:56,620
- Where?
- There.

509
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:19,746
What is it?

510
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:33,626
He's rocking the ship.

511
00:54:33,964 --> 00:54:35,591
We're rocking the ship.

512
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:42,570
Aye. He's onto it.

513
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,604
He's rocking the ship.

514
00:54:46,677 --> 00:54:49,077
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

515
00:54:49,146 --> 00:54:51,808
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

516
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,440
Time it with the swell.

517
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:59,783
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

518
00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:05,154
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

519
00:56:10,127 --> 00:56:11,492
Now up...

520
00:56:13,063 --> 00:56:14,394
...is down.

521
00:57:50,394 --> 00:57:52,385
This was your idea.

522
00:57:53,964 --> 00:57:56,455
Blessed sweet westerlies!

523
00:57:57,601 --> 00:57:58,590
We're back!

524
00:58:02,406 --> 00:58:03,703
It's the sunrise.

525
00:58:16,853 --> 00:58:18,844
Parley?

526
00:58:18,922 --> 00:58:21,390
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

527
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,239
All right, then!

528
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:41,436
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.

529
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:45,208
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.

530
00:58:45,282 --> 00:58:46,681
I is arguing the point.

531
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:50,379
If there's pirates a-gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

532
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:53,890
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

533
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:56,255
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

534
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:59,352
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

535
00:58:59,429 --> 00:59:01,056
till there be none left but you.

536
00:59:01,965 --> 00:59:07,426
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

537
00:59:07,504 --> 00:59:08,528
Aye.

538
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:13,408
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

539
00:59:13,477 --> 00:59:15,468
I'm still working on that.

540
00:59:15,545 --> 00:59:20,039
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

541
00:59:25,722 --> 00:59:27,053
Wet powder.

542
00:59:29,793 --> 00:59:33,320
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

543
00:59:35,332 --> 00:59:37,857
- Ow!
- Sorry. Effective, though.

544
00:59:38,969 --> 00:59:40,994
There's fresh water on this island.

545
00:59:41,071 --> 00:59:44,700
We can re-supply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

546
00:59:45,008 --> 00:59:47,806
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

547
00:59:48,278 --> 00:59:50,712
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

548
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:54,410
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

549
00:59:55,652 --> 00:59:56,983
Temporarily.

550
01:00:14,805 --> 01:00:16,363
Mind the boat.

551
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:30,318
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

552
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:51,330
Careful! Careful!

553
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:54,776
You stupid fish!

554
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,879
Actually it's a cephalopod.

555
01:00:57,347 --> 01:00:58,541
Serves you right.

556
01:00:58,682 --> 01:01:01,674
Pin, I bet people
would pay a shilling to see this.

557
01:01:01,752 --> 01:01:04,915
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

558
01:01:04,988 --> 01:01:08,014
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

559
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:10,924
We could serve up
a slice as a souvenir.

560
01:01:10,994 --> 01:01:13,588
Still thinking of running, Jack?

561
01:01:14,364 --> 01:01:16,855
Think you can outrun the world?

562
01:01:22,539 --> 01:01:26,373
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

563
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:29,139
...by and by, there be none left at all.

564
01:01:30,547 --> 01:01:35,541
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

565
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,747
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

566
01:01:39,456 --> 01:01:42,118
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

567
01:01:42,626 --> 01:01:45,288
But passing on, that's dead certain.

568
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:51,657
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

569
01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:53,464
It's our only hope, lad.

570
01:01:54,871 --> 01:01:57,863
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

571
01:01:59,509 --> 01:02:02,171
The world used to be a bigger place.

572
01:02:04,848 --> 01:02:06,748
The world's still the same.

573
01:02:08,685 --> 01:02:11,449
There's just... less in it.

574
01:02:33,743 --> 01:02:36,075
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

575
01:02:38,882 --> 01:02:42,682
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!

576
01:02:42,752 --> 01:02:44,743
- Singapore.
- Captain!

577
01:02:47,591 --> 01:02:48,683
Hoy!

578
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:51,556
We got company!

579
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,734
He's the captain.

580
01:03:15,185 --> 01:03:16,482
Sao Feng...

581
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:21,047
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

582
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,487
Jack Sparrow.

583
01:03:27,464 --> 01:03:29,557
You paid me great insult once.

584
01:03:29,633 --> 01:03:31,123
That doesn't sound like me.

585
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:38,200
Shall we just call it square, then?

586
01:03:38,742 --> 01:03:39,902
Release her.

587
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:44,544
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

588
01:03:45,415 --> 01:03:47,406
You heard Captain Turner.

589
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:51,546
- Release her!
- "Captain Turner"?

590
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:54,385
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

591
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:57,017
I need the Pearl to free my father.

592
01:03:57,093 --> 01:03:59,584
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

593
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:02,963
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

594
01:04:03,033 --> 01:04:05,228
It was my burden to bear.

595
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,770
He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.

596
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:15,902
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

597
01:04:16,947 --> 01:04:19,882
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

598
01:04:29,092 --> 01:04:30,559
I'm standing with them.

599
01:04:32,729 --> 01:04:38,395
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

600
01:04:38,468 --> 01:04:42,097
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

601
01:04:44,507 --> 01:04:46,737
Here is your chance to find out.

602
01:04:56,152 --> 01:04:57,813
Curious.

603
01:04:57,887 --> 01:05:01,050
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

604
01:05:01,124 --> 01:05:05,652
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

605
01:05:05,729 --> 01:05:07,697
can defeat the Flying Dutchman.

606
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:11,867
And so despair leads to betrayal.

607
01:05:12,268 --> 01:05:16,261
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

608
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:20,532
It's not here, Jack.

609
01:05:21,945 --> 01:05:23,344
What? What isn't?

610
01:05:23,413 --> 01:05:27,907
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,

611
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:31,010
and so unavailable for use as leverage

612
01:05:31,087 --> 01:05:33,749
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

613
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:37,088
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

614
01:05:37,227 --> 01:05:39,286
By your death?

615
01:05:39,362 --> 01:05:41,421
And yet here you are.

616
01:05:41,965 --> 01:05:44,593
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

617
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,100
That's how I get by.

618
01:05:47,003 --> 01:05:50,632
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

619
01:05:51,241 --> 01:05:52,708
Ship oars.

620
01:05:52,776 --> 01:05:54,334
Ship oars.

621
01:05:54,644 --> 01:05:56,236
Be on your guard, men.

622
01:05:58,882 --> 01:06:00,747
My men are crew enough.

623
01:06:00,817 --> 01:06:02,978
Company ship, company crew.

624
01:06:04,054 --> 01:06:06,955
You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.

625
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:09,256
And so it was.

626
01:06:12,328 --> 01:06:15,388
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

627
01:06:15,465 --> 01:06:20,698
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

628
01:06:27,143 --> 01:06:31,842
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

629
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,975
Square my debt with Jones...

630
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:37,884
...guarantee my freedom?

631
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:39,581
Of course.

632
01:06:39,656 --> 01:06:41,590
It's just good business.

633
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:47,460
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

634
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:49,725
Everything.

635
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,497
Where are they meeting?

636
01:06:52,302 --> 01:06:54,293
Who are the pirate lords?

637
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:58,468
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

638
01:06:59,109 --> 01:07:02,237
Prepare the brig.

639
01:07:04,914 --> 01:07:09,817
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.

640
01:07:09,886 --> 01:07:13,549
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?

641
01:07:20,697 --> 01:07:25,066
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

642
01:07:25,135 --> 01:07:28,366
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

643
01:07:29,038 --> 01:07:32,235
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

644
01:07:32,308 --> 01:07:36,836
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

645
01:07:36,913 --> 01:07:40,781
- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.

646
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,340
Now the Pearl!

647
01:07:43,353 --> 01:07:45,287
And what do the Brethren have?

648
01:07:45,989 --> 01:07:49,049
We have Calypso.

649
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,199
Calypso.

650
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:03,262
An old legend.

651
01:08:04,407 --> 01:08:09,344
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

652
01:08:09,779 --> 01:08:15,046
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

653
01:08:15,118 --> 01:08:20,420
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

654
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:24,384
All the Court.

655
01:08:26,262 --> 01:08:27,957
You can keep Barbossa.

656
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:32,092
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

657
01:08:32,168 --> 01:08:34,693
And Turner. Especially Turner.

658
01:08:34,771 --> 01:08:38,229
The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

659
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:42,642
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

660
01:08:42,712 --> 01:08:47,240
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

661
01:08:49,986 --> 01:08:52,113
What interest is she to you?

662
01:08:54,657 --> 01:08:57,023
What are you proposing, captain?

663
01:08:57,093 --> 01:09:00,085
What be accepting, cap'n?

664
01:09:01,564 --> 01:09:03,930
- The girl.
- What?

665
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,558
Jack.

666
01:09:06,236 --> 01:09:08,033
I've just recalled.

667
01:09:08,104 --> 01:09:13,098
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

668
01:09:13,643 --> 01:09:15,907
So for what do I need you?

669
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:18,004
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

670
01:09:18,815 --> 01:09:20,146
Out of the question.

671
01:09:20,216 --> 01:09:22,013
It was not a question.

672
01:09:22,085 --> 01:09:23,848
Points to the thing you want most.

673
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,115
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

674
01:09:26,189 --> 01:09:29,420
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

675
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,521
- Dead.
- Done.

676
01:09:32,595 --> 01:09:35,257
What? Not done.

677
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:37,891
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

678
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:39,059
Damn.

679
01:09:43,273 --> 01:09:47,039
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass

680
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:51,604
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

681
01:09:51,948 --> 01:09:54,314
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

682
01:09:54,384 --> 01:09:56,113
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

683
01:09:56,185 --> 01:09:59,677
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

684
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,656
Then we have an accord?

685
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:07,087
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

686
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:10,360
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

687
01:10:10,433 --> 01:10:13,368
...able to withstand blockade for years.

688
01:10:13,436 --> 01:10:17,998
Then you'd be wishing, "lf only there
was someone I had not killed inside

689
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:21,577
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

690
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:24,345
And you can accomplish all this?

691
01:10:25,648 --> 01:10:28,708
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

692
01:10:29,052 --> 01:10:30,110
Who am I?

693
01:10:32,422 --> 01:10:34,117
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

694
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,120
Done!

695
01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:13,555
Man overboard!

696
01:11:27,643 --> 01:11:28,837
You're mad.

697
01:11:29,145 --> 01:11:32,376
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

698
01:11:50,066 --> 01:11:53,229
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

699
01:12:00,743 --> 01:12:05,510
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

700
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,411
Which ship do we follow?

701
01:12:09,485 --> 01:12:14,149
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.

702
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:17,649
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

703
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:21,827
She's going down!

704
01:12:21,898 --> 01:12:23,422
Stand clear!

705
01:12:27,537 --> 01:12:32,440
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

706
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:35,299
Sir.

707
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:23,716
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

708
01:13:26,262 --> 01:13:27,661
Calypso.

709
01:13:28,764 --> 01:13:30,231
Excuse me?

710
01:13:31,267 --> 01:13:35,363
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...

711
01:13:35,938 --> 01:13:37,565
...but it is what we call you.

712
01:13:39,475 --> 01:13:40,669
We being who?

713
01:13:45,414 --> 01:13:47,211
You confirm it.

714
01:13:48,584 --> 01:13:49,983
Confirm what?

715
01:13:51,254 --> 01:13:55,850
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

716
01:13:55,925 --> 01:14:00,521
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

717
01:14:01,631 --> 01:14:03,531
They bound you to human form

718
01:14:03,599 --> 01:14:07,057
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

719
01:14:07,136 --> 01:14:08,899
To me.

720
01:14:11,474 --> 01:14:16,343
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

721
01:14:16,412 --> 01:14:19,006
Pretty speech from a captor.

722
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:23,074
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

723
01:14:23,419 --> 01:14:26,411
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

724
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:32,657
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

725
01:14:32,728 --> 01:14:36,528
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

726
01:14:37,567 --> 01:14:40,092
I offer simply my desire.

727
01:14:41,571 --> 01:14:43,061
And in return?

728
01:14:44,173 --> 01:14:48,109
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

729
01:14:52,181 --> 01:14:56,174
And if I should choose not?

730
01:14:57,687 --> 01:14:59,655
Then I will take...

731
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:02,014
...your fury.

732
01:15:27,817 --> 01:15:29,114
Sao Feng?

733
01:15:30,686 --> 01:15:31,812
Here.

734
01:15:32,221 --> 01:15:33,688
Please.

735
01:15:39,562 --> 01:15:43,089
With all nine pieces of eight...

736
01:15:45,568 --> 01:15:47,627
...you will be free.

737
01:15:49,472 --> 01:15:50,598
Take it!

738
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:54,272
You are captain now.

739
01:15:55,444 --> 01:15:56,468
Me?

740
01:15:59,115 --> 01:16:03,711
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

741
01:16:05,788 --> 01:16:08,382
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

742
01:16:09,825 --> 01:16:13,386
Forgive me... Calypso.

743
01:16:22,638 --> 01:16:23,730
Sao.

744
01:16:28,844 --> 01:16:30,539
What did he tell you?

745
01:16:35,618 --> 01:16:37,483
He made me captain.

746
01:16:39,755 --> 01:16:41,985
Set! Fire!

747
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:49,455
You are not my captain.

748
01:16:49,732 --> 01:16:51,063
Elizabeth.

749
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:53,492
James. James.

750
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,208
Thank God, you're alive.

751
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:02,468
Your father'll be overjoyed

752
01:17:02,545 --> 01:17:05,378
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

753
01:17:05,848 --> 01:17:08,578
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

754
01:17:09,585 --> 01:17:11,519
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

755
01:17:12,822 --> 01:17:15,586
Who among you
do you name as captain?

756
01:17:15,658 --> 01:17:17,148
Captain. Her.

757
01:17:17,226 --> 01:17:18,887
Her.

758
01:17:21,764 --> 01:17:22,856
Captain?

759
01:17:22,932 --> 01:17:26,595
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

760
01:17:27,903 --> 01:17:29,871
The captain shall have my quarters.

761
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,907
Thank you, sir.

762
01:17:32,975 --> 01:17:36,706
- But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.

763
01:17:36,779 --> 01:17:38,269
I swear.

764
01:17:39,215 --> 01:17:40,273
I did not know.

765
01:17:40,349 --> 01:17:44,479
Know what?
Which side you chose?

766
01:17:52,495 --> 01:17:54,258
Well, now you do.

767
01:18:02,938 --> 01:18:03,927
Bootstrap?

768
01:18:12,548 --> 01:18:13,845
Bootstrap.

769
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:15,578
Bill Turner?

770
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:17,845
Bootstrap.

771
01:18:27,029 --> 01:18:28,929
You know my name.

772
01:18:32,434 --> 01:18:33,799
Yes, I know your son.

773
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:37,395
Will Turner.

774
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:39,933
William.

775
01:18:45,815 --> 01:18:48,306
He made it. He's alive.

776
01:18:48,384 --> 01:18:52,616
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

777
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:56,956
God's wounds. He's on his way.

778
01:18:57,026 --> 01:18:58,391
Yes, Will is alive.

779
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:01,387
And he wants to help you.

780
01:19:06,869 --> 01:19:10,498
He can't help me. He won't come.

781
01:19:11,273 --> 01:19:12,831
But you're his father.

782
01:19:13,676 --> 01:19:15,439
I know you.

783
01:19:16,278 --> 01:19:17,836
He spoke of you.

784
01:19:19,815 --> 01:19:22,978
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

785
01:19:24,353 --> 01:19:25,377
Me?

786
01:19:26,922 --> 01:19:28,651
You're Elizabeth.

787
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:31,492
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

788
01:19:33,295 --> 01:19:38,255
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

789
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:41,701
Captain... Forever.

790
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:47,542
The Dutchman
must always have a captain.

791
01:19:48,244 --> 01:19:50,337
And if he saves me...

792
01:19:51,547 --> 01:19:53,412
...he loses you.

793
01:19:56,385 --> 01:19:57,477
I see.

794
01:19:59,455 --> 01:20:01,320
He won't pick me.

795
01:20:02,258 --> 01:20:04,419
I wouldn't pick me.

796
01:20:09,498 --> 01:20:11,022
Tell him not to come.

797
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:15,362
Tell him to stay away.

798
01:20:16,672 --> 01:20:18,697
Tell him it's too late.

799
01:20:20,276 --> 01:20:22,540
I'm already a part of the ship...

800
01:20:24,613 --> 01:20:26,240
...and the crew.

801
01:20:28,417 --> 01:20:29,406
Bootstrap.

802
01:20:32,488 --> 01:20:34,388
You know my name.

803
01:20:35,291 --> 01:20:37,384
You know my name.

804
01:20:38,627 --> 01:20:40,458
Yes, I know your son.

805
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:43,158
William.

806
01:20:45,768 --> 01:20:47,736
He's coming for me.

807
01:20:48,437 --> 01:20:49,927
Wait and see.

808
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,371
You'll see.

809
01:20:53,776 --> 01:20:55,539
He promised.

810
01:21:11,961 --> 01:21:13,895
Swing her over.

811
01:21:15,097 --> 01:21:16,860
Ready those lines.

812
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:29,770
Sir.

813
01:21:33,148 --> 01:21:35,013
A breadcrumb trail.

814
01:21:35,084 --> 01:21:39,418
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

815
01:21:39,488 --> 01:21:44,653
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

816
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:49,954
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

817
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,064
We can only hope
to reach our destination

818
01:21:54,136 --> 01:21:56,161
before they run out of bodies.

819
01:22:09,818 --> 01:22:12,878
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

820
01:22:13,822 --> 01:22:17,223
William, do you notice anything?

821
01:22:18,894 --> 01:22:20,122
Rather...

822
01:22:20,529 --> 01:22:24,056
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

823
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:27,825
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

824
01:22:27,903 --> 01:22:29,370
Not as odd as this.

825
01:22:30,773 --> 01:22:33,241
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

826
01:22:33,308 --> 01:22:36,334
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."

827
01:22:36,712 --> 01:22:38,907
This is what you've arrived at?

828
01:22:38,981 --> 01:22:42,314
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

829
01:22:42,384 --> 01:22:44,215
...accomplish your own ends?

830
01:22:44,286 --> 01:22:46,083
It's like you don't know me at all.

831
01:22:49,391 --> 01:22:52,485
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

832
01:22:53,862 --> 01:22:55,193
Ah.

833
01:22:55,798 --> 01:22:58,323
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

834
01:23:01,703 --> 01:23:03,261
I'm losing her, Jack.

835
01:23:04,006 --> 01:23:07,942
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

836
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:12,107
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

837
01:23:12,648 --> 01:23:15,845
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

838
01:23:17,019 --> 01:23:18,987
...avoid the choice altogether.

839
01:23:19,822 --> 01:23:21,289
Change the facts.

840
01:23:22,357 --> 01:23:25,349
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

841
01:23:26,128 --> 01:23:27,459
Who?

842
01:23:31,733 --> 01:23:32,722
You?

843
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:38,471
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

844
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:42,067
I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,

845
01:23:42,144 --> 01:23:43,907
your father's free from his debt,

846
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:46,709
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

847
01:23:46,782 --> 01:23:50,616
You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...

848
01:23:50,686 --> 01:23:54,645
...forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.

849
01:23:54,723 --> 01:23:58,750
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

850
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:01,153
You have to do the job though, Jack.

851
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:04,290
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

852
01:24:04,933 --> 01:24:07,527
Or end up just like Jones.

853
01:24:09,605 --> 01:24:11,596
I don't have the face for tentacles.

854
01:24:13,442 --> 01:24:16,002
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

855
01:24:20,015 --> 01:24:21,175
What's this for?

856
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,946
Think like me. It'll come to you.

857
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,599
My regards to Davy Jones.

858
01:24:44,873 --> 01:24:46,340
I hate him.

859
01:24:50,913 --> 01:24:52,039
Come with me.

860
01:24:55,617 --> 01:24:56,845
Quickly.

861
01:25:05,894 --> 01:25:07,156
What are you doing?

862
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:10,855
Choosing a side.

863
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:39,349
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

864
01:25:39,428 --> 01:25:41,760
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

865
01:25:43,098 --> 01:25:45,225
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

866
01:25:46,468 --> 01:25:49,266
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

867
01:25:51,473 --> 01:25:54,465
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

868
01:25:58,013 --> 01:25:59,071
Come with us.

869
01:26:03,151 --> 01:26:04,846
James, come with me.

870
01:26:06,054 --> 01:26:07,954
Who goes there?

871
01:26:10,726 --> 01:26:12,660
Go. I will follow.

872
01:26:14,263 --> 01:26:15,924
You're lying.

873
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:21,568
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

874
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:25,463
...but never joined.

875
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,675
Go, now.

876
01:26:39,655 --> 01:26:41,816
Back to your station, sailor.

877
01:26:43,659 --> 01:26:48,926
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

878
01:26:48,997 --> 01:26:50,692
That's an order.

879
01:26:51,767 --> 01:26:54,429
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

880
01:26:54,503 --> 01:26:57,267
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

881
01:26:57,339 --> 01:27:00,240
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

882
01:27:00,309 --> 01:27:02,709
All hands, prisoner escape!

883
01:27:03,045 --> 01:27:05,275
- Belay that!
- James!

884
01:27:17,025 --> 01:27:19,118
Prisoner escape!

885
01:27:21,563 --> 01:27:23,224
James! No!

886
01:27:32,307 --> 01:27:35,105
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

887
01:27:35,177 --> 01:27:37,202
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

888
01:27:40,415 --> 01:27:42,975
To the captain's cabin!

889
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:45,042
Back to the ship.

890
01:27:47,022 --> 01:27:50,958
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

891
01:28:00,302 --> 01:28:02,361
I take that as a "no."

892
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,399
Nice sword.

893
01:28:29,364 --> 01:28:34,392
The Dutchman is under my command.

894
01:28:36,905 --> 01:28:39,203
For now.

895
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:57,040
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

896
01:28:57,117 --> 01:28:59,517
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

897
01:28:59,586 --> 01:29:03,022
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

898
01:29:03,089 --> 01:29:05,523
You heard him. Step lively.

899
01:29:05,592 --> 01:29:07,924
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

900
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:10,827
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

901
01:29:10,897 --> 01:29:12,125
Aye.

902
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:16,329
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

903
01:29:16,403 --> 01:29:17,995
What'd you call him?

904
01:29:19,172 --> 01:29:20,400
Larry.

905
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:27,079
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

906
01:29:27,147 --> 01:29:29,138
But we agreed on ends only.

907
01:29:29,216 --> 01:29:32,185
The means are mine to decide.

908
01:29:32,252 --> 01:29:34,743
Caution, Barbossa.

909
01:29:34,821 --> 01:29:39,053
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

910
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:42,959
Or what it mean if you fail me.

911
01:29:46,233 --> 01:29:49,100
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

912
01:29:49,169 --> 01:29:52,900
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

913
01:29:53,807 --> 01:29:56,332
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

914
01:29:56,877 --> 01:30:00,176
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

915
01:30:00,247 --> 01:30:02,442
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

916
01:30:04,284 --> 01:30:07,378
Take this fishwife to the brig.

917
01:30:09,222 --> 01:30:11,349
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

918
01:30:39,185 --> 01:30:43,178
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

919
01:30:43,256 --> 01:30:45,190
Apparently, you can.

920
01:30:45,725 --> 01:30:47,386
I believe you know each other.

921
01:30:52,253 --> 01:30:56,383
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

922
01:30:56,457 --> 01:30:57,822
Not yours.

923
01:30:58,259 --> 01:30:59,453
His.

924
01:31:00,361 --> 01:31:02,488
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

925
01:31:03,598 --> 01:31:05,429
Sparrow?

926
01:31:06,868 --> 01:31:08,460
You didn't tell him.

927
01:31:08,536 --> 01:31:11,767
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the Black Pearl.

928
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:15,441
What else have you not told me?

929
01:31:16,211 --> 01:31:20,204
There is an issue far more troublesome.

930
01:31:21,549 --> 01:31:25,144
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

931
01:31:27,789 --> 01:31:29,484
Not a person.

932
01:31:30,225 --> 01:31:31,283
A heathen god.

933
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:34,886
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams

934
01:31:34,963 --> 01:31:38,296
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

935
01:31:38,366 --> 01:31:41,494
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

936
01:31:42,403 --> 01:31:44,997
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

937
01:31:45,807 --> 01:31:47,604
No! They cannot!

938
01:31:47,675 --> 01:31:50,644
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

939
01:31:50,712 --> 01:31:53,681
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

940
01:31:56,217 --> 01:32:00,210
I showed them how to bind her.

941
01:32:00,288 --> 01:32:02,256
She could not be trusted.

942
01:32:02,323 --> 01:32:04,154
I... She gave me no choice.

943
01:32:04,726 --> 01:32:07,661
We must act before they release her.

944
01:32:07,729 --> 01:32:09,492
You loved her.

945
01:32:10,732 --> 01:32:12,700
She's the one.

946
01:32:12,767 --> 01:32:14,758
And then you betrayed her.

947
01:32:14,836 --> 01:32:18,636
She pretended to love me.

948
01:32:18,706 --> 01:32:22,472
She betrayed me.

949
01:32:25,313 --> 01:32:28,840
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.

950
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,816
Do not test me.

951
01:32:34,889 --> 01:32:36,618
I hadn't finished that.

952
01:32:38,626 --> 01:32:40,753
You will free my father.

953
01:32:41,462 --> 01:32:43,930
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

954
01:32:43,998 --> 01:32:45,590
Along with my own.

955
01:32:45,667 --> 01:32:48,227
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

956
01:32:48,303 --> 01:32:51,067
We will expect fair value in return.

957
01:32:51,506 --> 01:32:55,442
There is only one price I will accept:

958
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:58,570
Calypso murdered.

959
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:02,813
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.

960
01:33:04,886 --> 01:33:08,253
Jack has sailed
the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.

961
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:14,523
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?

962
01:33:26,374 --> 01:33:28,934
What is it you want most?

963
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:02,433
Look at them all.

964
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:06,606
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

965
01:34:07,415 --> 01:34:09,406
And I owe them all money.

966
01:34:14,822 --> 01:34:17,290
As he who issued summons,

967
01:34:17,358 --> 01:34:21,920
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

968
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,458
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

969
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:34,303
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

970
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:45,647
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

971
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,451
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

972
01:34:49,524 --> 01:34:53,858
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

973
01:34:54,562 --> 01:34:55,620
So change the name.

974
01:34:56,831 --> 01:35:01,029
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

975
01:35:01,102 --> 01:35:03,434
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

976
01:35:07,075 --> 01:35:09,566
Master Ragetti, if you will.

977
01:35:10,378 --> 01:35:13,370
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

978
01:35:13,448 --> 01:35:16,542
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.

979
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:20,512
Sparrow.

980
01:35:26,627 --> 01:35:30,256
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

981
01:35:30,331 --> 01:35:34,290
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

982
01:35:34,368 --> 01:35:35,960
Sao Feng is dead.

983
01:35:38,106 --> 01:35:40,199
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.

984
01:35:40,441 --> 01:35:41,567
The plagued ship.

985
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:46,211
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

986
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,249
- £¡Que lo manden al diablo!
- Listen. Listen to me.

987
01:35:49,317 --> 01:35:51,547
Our location has been betrayed.

988
01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:55,248
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

989
01:35:55,323 --> 01:35:59,020
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

990
01:35:59,393 --> 01:36:01,418
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

991
01:36:01,496 --> 01:36:04,226
It matters not how they found us.
The question is,

992
01:36:04,298 --> 01:36:06,789
what will we do now that they have?

993
01:36:06,868 --> 01:36:08,358
We fight.

994
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,876
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

995
01:36:15,943 --> 01:36:18,741
A well-supplied fortress.

996
01:36:19,347 --> 01:36:23,147
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

997
01:36:23,918 --> 01:36:27,285
There be a third course.

998
01:36:28,523 --> 01:36:30,957
In another age, at this very spot,

999
01:36:31,025 --> 01:36:36,520
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

1000
01:36:39,267 --> 01:36:40,700
That was a mistake.

1001
01:36:41,702 --> 01:36:44,466
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

1002
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:48,533
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

1003
01:36:50,545 --> 01:36:52,979
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

1004
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:56,881
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

1005
01:36:56,951 --> 01:37:01,320
but from the sweat of a mars brow
and the strength of his back alone.

1006
01:37:01,389 --> 01:37:03,220
You all know this to be true.

1007
01:37:04,058 --> 01:37:05,423
Gentlemen.

1008
01:37:06,527 --> 01:37:07,687
Ladies.

1009
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:15,325
We must free Calypso.

1010
01:37:24,345 --> 01:37:26,779
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

1011
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:30,749
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

1012
01:37:30,818 --> 01:37:33,343
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

1013
01:37:33,421 --> 01:37:36,322
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

1014
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:38,324
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

1015
01:37:38,392 --> 01:37:42,226
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

1016
01:37:42,296 --> 01:37:45,231
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.

1017
01:37:57,478 --> 01:38:00,641
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

1018
01:38:00,715 --> 01:38:03,309
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

1019
01:38:03,384 --> 01:38:05,909
If they not be here already.

1020
01:38:42,123 --> 01:38:44,489
My sweet.

1021
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:46,919
You come for me.

1022
01:38:47,895 --> 01:38:52,855
- You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.

1023
01:38:52,933 --> 01:38:57,165
Trapped in this single form.

1024
01:38:57,705 --> 01:39:00,071
Cut off from the sea.

1025
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:03,135
From all that I love.

1026
01:39:04,412 --> 01:39:05,811
From you.

1027
01:39:06,514 --> 01:39:11,042
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.

1028
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:17,824
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

1029
01:39:18,492 --> 01:39:23,054
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

1030
01:39:24,832 --> 01:39:28,632
...you weren't there.

1031
01:39:29,036 --> 01:39:31,630
Why weren't you there?

1032
01:39:35,042 --> 01:39:36,669
It's my nature.

1033
01:39:37,878 --> 01:39:42,474
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

1034
01:39:43,651 --> 01:39:47,451
I do not love you.

1035
01:39:49,957 --> 01:39:53,654
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

1036
01:39:54,729 --> 01:39:56,856
But never cruel.

1037
01:39:57,698 --> 01:40:00,667
You have corrupted your purpose...

1038
01:40:02,036 --> 01:40:04,630
...and so your self.

1039
01:40:05,706 --> 01:40:10,575
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

1040
01:40:30,464 --> 01:40:33,524
Calypso.

1041
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,435
I will be free.

1042
01:40:40,374 --> 01:40:44,071
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.

1043
01:40:44,845 --> 01:40:47,837
And we would be together always.

1044
01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:51,849
If only you had a heart to give.

1045
01:40:56,624 --> 01:40:58,683
Why did you come?

1046
01:41:15,976 --> 01:41:21,141
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

1047
01:41:21,549 --> 01:41:23,540
The Brethren Court?

1048
01:41:25,519 --> 01:41:30,320
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...

1049
01:41:30,391 --> 01:41:33,087
...is how cruel I can be.

1050
01:41:37,665 --> 01:41:42,125
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

1051
01:41:43,604 --> 01:41:47,096
My heart will always belong to you.

1052
01:42:00,488 --> 01:42:04,288
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

1053
01:42:04,358 --> 01:42:06,656
We should be the ones to set her free.

1054
01:42:06,727 --> 01:42:11,061
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

1055
01:42:11,131 --> 01:42:13,599
Whose boons? Your boons?

1056
01:42:13,667 --> 01:42:16,659
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

1057
01:42:16,737 --> 01:42:21,140
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

1058
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:23,433
Cuttlefish.

1059
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:26,704
Aye.

1060
01:42:27,681 --> 01:42:30,309
Let us not, dear friends,

1061
01:42:30,384 --> 01:42:33,376
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

1062
01:42:33,921 --> 01:42:36,116
Flipping glorious little sausages.

1063
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:40,149
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

1064
01:42:40,227 --> 01:42:41,489
Human nature, isn't it?

1065
01:42:41,562 --> 01:42:43,587
Or... Or fish nature.

1066
01:42:43,664 --> 01:42:47,395
So, yes, we could hole up here
well-provisioned and well-armed.

1067
01:42:47,468 --> 01:42:49,629
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

1068
01:42:49,703 --> 01:42:53,639
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

1069
01:42:55,509 --> 01:42:56,840
Uh...

1070
01:42:58,579 --> 01:43:04,347
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

1071
01:43:04,418 --> 01:43:08,411
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

1072
01:43:09,924 --> 01:43:11,186
I rather doubt it.

1073
01:43:11,992 --> 01:43:15,985
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

1074
01:43:16,063 --> 01:43:18,930
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

1075
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:23,365
Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.

1076
01:43:23,437 --> 01:43:26,201
We are left with but one option.

1077
01:43:26,273 --> 01:43:30,141
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

1078
01:43:32,446 --> 01:43:35,381
...Captain Swann. We must fight.

1079
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:38,680
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

1080
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,810
- Have so.
- Have not.

1081
01:43:39,954 --> 01:43:41,012
- Have so.
- Have not!

1082
01:43:41,155 --> 01:43:44,318
- You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

1083
01:43:44,391 --> 01:43:48,691
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1084
01:43:48,762 --> 01:43:52,960
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

1085
01:43:53,033 --> 01:43:54,432
We must fight...

1086
01:43:55,202 --> 01:43:56,692
...to run away.

1087
01:43:56,770 --> 01:43:59,102
- Aye!
- Aye!

1088
01:44:00,874 --> 01:44:05,311
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

1089
01:44:05,379 --> 01:44:08,280
can only be declared by the pirate king.

1090
01:44:08,349 --> 01:44:10,909
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?

1091
01:44:10,985 --> 01:44:15,513
I call on Cap'n Teague,
keeper of the code.

1092
01:44:16,523 --> 01:44:19,959
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

1093
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:24,086
Hang the code. Who cares a...?

1094
01:44:32,106 --> 01:44:33,937
Code is the law.

1095
01:44:45,953 --> 01:44:47,944
You're in my way, boy.

1096
01:44:57,164 --> 01:44:59,792
- The code.
- The code.

1097
01:44:59,867 --> 01:45:02,131
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

1098
01:45:20,154 --> 01:45:24,113
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

1099
01:45:26,994 --> 01:45:28,484
Sea turtles.

1100
01:45:43,277 --> 01:45:45,973
Ah. Barbossa is right.

1101
01:45:46,046 --> 01:45:47,536
Hang on a minute.

1102
01:45:49,016 --> 01:45:50,984
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

1103
01:45:51,051 --> 01:45:54,509
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries..."

1104
01:45:54,588 --> 01:45:55,577
Fancy that.

1105
01:45:55,656 --> 01:45:58,124
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

1106
01:45:58,192 --> 01:45:59,853
And that's not likely to change.

1107
01:45:59,927 --> 01:46:01,952
- Not likely.
- Why not?

1108
01:46:02,096 --> 01:46:04,724
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

1109
01:46:04,798 --> 01:46:08,290
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

1110
01:46:08,368 --> 01:46:09,460
I call for a vote.

1111
01:46:14,274 --> 01:46:16,640
I vote for Ammand the corsair.

1112
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:19,270
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

1113
01:46:19,646 --> 01:46:22,308
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

1114
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:25,151
Mistress Ching.

1115
01:46:25,219 --> 01:46:26,618
Gentleman Jocard.

1116
01:46:27,321 --> 01:46:29,881
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.

1117
01:46:29,957 --> 01:46:31,720
Vallenueva!

1118
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:33,890
Elizabeth Swann.

1119
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:36,862
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

1120
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:41,026
Vote for me. Vote for me.

1121
01:46:43,504 --> 01:46:44,903
What you talking about?

1122
01:46:44,972 --> 01:46:46,064
No!

1123
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:49,769
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?

1124
01:46:58,652 --> 01:46:59,846
Very well.

1125
01:47:03,223 --> 01:47:08,217
What say you, Captain Swann,
king of the Brethren Court?

1126
01:47:10,197 --> 01:47:12,529
Prepare every vessel that floats.

1127
01:47:13,367 --> 01:47:14,527
At dawn...

1128
01:47:16,103 --> 01:47:17,297
...we're at war.

1129
01:47:21,108 --> 01:47:24,703
And so we shall go to war.

1130
01:47:38,392 --> 01:47:39,381
What?

1131
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:43,158
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.

1132
01:47:43,697 --> 01:47:46,530
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

1133
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:50,558
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

1134
01:47:54,508 --> 01:47:58,604
The trick is
living with yourself forever.

1135
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:03,809
How's Mum?

1136
01:48:10,757 --> 01:48:12,281
She looks great.

1137
01:48:33,714 --> 01:48:37,309
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

1138
01:49:00,674 --> 01:49:03,165
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

1139
01:49:12,119 --> 01:49:13,279
Parley?

1140
01:50:10,077 --> 01:50:13,706
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

1141
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:17,978
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

1142
01:50:18,051 --> 01:50:22,579
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

1143
01:50:25,993 --> 01:50:27,688
My hands are clean in this.

1144
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:29,889
Figuratively.

1145
01:50:30,430 --> 01:50:32,898
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

1146
01:50:32,966 --> 01:50:36,402
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

1147
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:38,438
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.

1148
01:50:39,373 --> 01:50:42,706
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

1149
01:50:43,543 --> 01:50:47,411
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

1150
01:50:49,649 --> 01:50:54,552
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

1151
01:50:55,756 --> 01:51:00,716
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

1152
01:51:01,495 --> 01:51:04,862
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

1153
01:51:04,931 --> 01:51:08,833
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

1154
01:51:08,902 --> 01:51:13,862
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.

1155
01:51:14,541 --> 01:51:17,772
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

1156
01:51:17,844 --> 01:51:20,244
- You escaped.
- Technically.

1157
01:51:20,313 --> 01:51:22,372
I propose an exchange.

1158
01:51:24,451 --> 01:51:26,316
Will leaves with us...

1159
01:51:27,054 --> 01:51:28,817
...and you can take Jack.

1160
01:51:30,924 --> 01:51:31,913
Done.

1161
01:51:32,592 --> 01:51:34,287
- Undone.
- Done.

1162
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:37,888
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

1163
01:51:37,964 --> 01:51:39,431
King.

1164
01:51:41,935 --> 01:51:45,996
- As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!

1165
01:51:51,211 --> 01:51:54,908
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1166
01:51:57,584 --> 01:51:59,609
First to the finish, then?

1167
01:52:20,907 --> 01:52:23,467
Do you fear death?

1168
01:52:25,011 --> 01:52:26,774
You've no idea.

1169
01:52:29,716 --> 01:52:31,581
Advise your Brethren,

1170
01:52:31,651 --> 01:52:34,745
you can fight, and all of you will die.

1171
01:52:34,821 --> 01:52:39,349
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.

1172
01:52:39,926 --> 01:52:42,019
You murdered my father.

1173
01:52:43,396 --> 01:52:45,387
He chose his own fate.

1174
01:52:46,032 --> 01:52:48,762
And you have chosen yours.

1175
01:52:48,835 --> 01:52:50,894
We will fight.

1176
01:52:51,505 --> 01:52:53,302
And you will die.

1177
01:52:58,111 --> 01:52:59,738
So be it.

1178
01:53:05,752 --> 01:53:07,117
King?

1179
01:53:07,187 --> 01:53:10,020
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

1180
01:53:10,524 --> 01:53:12,856
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.

1181
01:53:19,299 --> 01:53:20,288
Bravo!

1182
01:53:21,334 --> 01:53:25,532
You've successfully arrived aboard
the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.

1183
01:53:25,605 --> 01:53:27,334
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

1184
01:53:27,407 --> 01:53:30,467
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1185
01:53:31,745 --> 01:53:32,905
Go away.

1186
01:53:32,979 --> 01:53:36,142
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

1187
01:53:36,983 --> 01:53:38,075
Stab the heart.

1188
01:53:43,957 --> 01:53:49,088
Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.

1189
01:53:52,899 --> 01:53:54,491
Then again...

1190
01:53:55,335 --> 01:53:57,030
...if you're in the brig...

1191
01:53:58,538 --> 01:54:00,529
...who's to stab the heart?

1192
01:54:03,043 --> 01:54:05,910
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

1193
01:54:07,647 --> 01:54:09,380
Peanut.

1194
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:12,645
We'll need to use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.

1195
01:54:12,716 --> 01:54:16,880
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.

1196
01:54:17,488 --> 01:54:20,924
Barbossa, you can't release her.

1197
01:54:20,991 --> 01:54:22,891
We need to give Jack a chance.

1198
01:54:23,494 --> 01:54:28,431
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

1199
01:54:31,301 --> 01:54:32,598
No longer.

1200
01:54:34,605 --> 01:54:36,300
The enemy...

1201
01:54:37,474 --> 01:54:39,806
...has opted for oblivion.

1202
01:54:42,946 --> 01:54:44,573
Ready the fleet.

1203
01:54:44,815 --> 01:54:47,545
- To your stations.
- To your stations.

1204
01:54:54,024 --> 01:54:57,187
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

1205
01:54:57,261 --> 01:54:58,523
Aye.

1206
01:54:58,962 --> 01:55:02,227
The items brought together, done.

1207
01:55:02,299 --> 01:55:04,699
Items to be burned...

1208
01:55:05,369 --> 01:55:07,530
...and someone must speak the words:

1209
01:55:07,604 --> 01:55:11,096
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."

1210
01:55:11,175 --> 01:55:12,164
Is that it?

1211
01:55:12,743 --> 01:55:16,804
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

1212
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,575
Ooh!

1213
01:55:22,653 --> 01:55:27,955
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

1214
01:55:37,534 --> 01:55:41,595
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.

1215
01:55:46,543 --> 01:55:47,567
He didn't...

1216
01:55:48,045 --> 01:55:49,910
You have to say it right.

1217
01:55:58,522 --> 01:55:59,511
Calypso...

1218
01:56:04,895 --> 01:56:07,329
...I release you from your human bonds.

1219
01:56:25,916 --> 01:56:27,611
Tia Dalma.

1220
01:56:30,053 --> 01:56:31,384
Calypso.

1221
01:56:33,857 --> 01:56:38,021
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

1222
01:56:40,464 --> 01:56:44,366
- Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.

1223
01:56:45,636 --> 01:56:47,399
Davy Jones.

1224
01:57:01,418 --> 01:57:05,252
This is it! This is it!

1225
01:57:47,864 --> 01:57:49,627
Calypso!

1226
01:57:51,835 --> 01:57:56,966
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

1227
01:57:58,875 --> 01:58:03,744
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favor.

1228
01:58:06,783 --> 01:58:09,775
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

1229
01:58:10,187 --> 01:58:14,647
...but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

1230
01:58:15,158 --> 01:58:16,318
...or mine.

1231
01:59:14,251 --> 01:59:15,513
Is that it?

1232
01:59:18,255 --> 01:59:20,246
Why, she's no help at all.

1233
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:25,257
What now?

1234
01:59:26,163 --> 01:59:27,425
Nothing.

1235
01:59:28,231 --> 01:59:31,166
Our final hope has failed us.

1236
01:59:58,628 --> 02:00:01,620
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

1237
02:00:01,698 --> 02:00:05,634
We've an armada against us, and
with the Dutchman, there's no chance.

1238
02:00:05,702 --> 02:00:08,000
There's only a fool's chance.

1239
02:00:08,071 --> 02:00:10,835
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

1240
02:00:10,907 --> 02:00:14,172
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

1241
02:00:19,149 --> 02:00:20,639
You're right.

1242
02:00:26,022 --> 02:00:27,990
Then what shall we die for?

1243
02:00:31,695 --> 02:00:33,094
You will listen to me.

1244
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:35,092
Listen!

1245
02:00:38,034 --> 02:00:43,097
The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.

1246
02:00:43,673 --> 02:00:45,106
And what will they see?

1247
02:00:45,609 --> 02:00:48,942
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

1248
02:00:49,012 --> 02:00:53,244
No, they will see free men and freedom!

1249
02:00:53,316 --> 02:00:56,752
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

1250
02:00:56,820 --> 02:01:02,053
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

1251
02:01:04,761 --> 02:01:07,059
By the sweat of our brows,

1252
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:09,462
and the strength of our backs...

1253
02:01:09,866 --> 02:01:12,858
...and the courage of our hearts.

1254
02:01:15,572 --> 02:01:17,062
Gentlemen...

1255
02:01:19,776 --> 02:01:21,243
...hoist the colors.

1256
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:24,713
Hoist the colors.

1257
02:01:24,781 --> 02:01:27,079
- Hoist the colors.
- Hoist the colors!

1258
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:29,209
Aye.

1259
02:01:29,286 --> 02:01:32,949
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!

1260
02:01:34,925 --> 02:01:37,018
Hoist the colors!

1261
02:02:28,078 --> 02:02:30,273
We have a favorable wind, sir.

1262
02:02:31,014 --> 02:02:32,208
Oh, so we do.

1263
02:02:32,849 --> 02:02:35,818
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

1264
02:02:36,853 --> 02:02:38,912
That should brighten his day.

1265
02:02:42,859 --> 02:02:46,795
To arms! We give no quarter!

1266
02:02:56,039 --> 02:02:57,836
Calypso.

1267
02:03:24,467 --> 02:03:27,402
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?

1268
02:03:27,470 --> 02:03:28,528
That's a bad sign.

1269
02:03:28,605 --> 02:03:33,542
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.

1270
02:03:48,158 --> 02:03:49,989
Maelstrom!

1271
02:03:53,196 --> 02:03:55,221
Captain Barbossa!

1272
02:03:56,166 --> 02:03:58,191
We need you at the helm.

1273
02:04:00,704 --> 02:04:03,070
Aye, that be true.

1274
02:04:05,375 --> 02:04:10,335
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes.

1275
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:14,482
Dying is the day worth living for.

1276
02:04:24,794 --> 02:04:26,421
Veer off!

1277
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:28,760
She'll not harm us.

1278
02:04:29,265 --> 02:04:31,597
Full-bore and into the abyss.

1279
02:04:32,302 --> 02:04:33,633
Are you mad?

1280
02:04:33,703 --> 02:04:36,672
Ha! You afraid to get wet?

1281
02:04:46,216 --> 02:04:48,582
She's on our stern and gaining.

1282
02:04:48,651 --> 02:04:54,214
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.

1283
02:05:01,197 --> 02:05:03,597
Bow cannons!

1284
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:06,568
Blow the cannons!

1285
02:05:17,447 --> 02:05:20,348
Take us out or they'll overbear us.

1286
02:05:20,417 --> 02:05:25,320
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.

1287
02:05:26,523 --> 02:05:28,616
Prepare to broadside.

1288
02:05:39,069 --> 02:05:41,333
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

1289
02:05:41,404 --> 02:05:45,238
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.

1290
02:05:52,415 --> 02:05:56,010
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.

1291
02:05:56,086 --> 02:05:58,281
Hinges. Hinges.

1292
02:05:58,354 --> 02:05:59,651
Think like the whelp.

1293
02:05:59,722 --> 02:06:01,155
Half-barrel hinges.

1294
02:06:01,257 --> 02:06:02,554
Leverage.

1295
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:09,760
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

1296
02:06:11,234 --> 02:06:14,067
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

1297
02:06:14,137 --> 02:06:15,695
Nobody move.

1298
02:06:16,773 --> 02:06:18,536
I dropped me brain.

1299
02:06:28,418 --> 02:06:31,182
Batten down the hatches!

1300
02:06:32,489 --> 02:06:34,514
Stand to your guns.

1301
02:06:35,091 --> 02:06:37,582
Midship canoneers, sight the masts.

1302
02:06:41,831 --> 02:06:44,265
Main battery at the ready!

1303
02:06:48,838 --> 02:06:53,104
Hold there!
Wait till we're board-and-board.

1304
02:06:57,680 --> 02:06:59,409
Fire!

1305
02:06:59,782 --> 02:07:04,116
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!

1306
02:07:05,054 --> 02:07:06,214
Fire!

1307
02:07:10,093 --> 02:07:11,651
Fire!

1308
02:07:21,237 --> 02:07:22,704
Come on, men.

1309
02:07:32,715 --> 02:07:37,345
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

1310
02:07:41,724 --> 02:07:43,954
Halt there or we'll shoot.

1311
02:07:45,461 --> 02:07:46,587
Good one.

1312
02:07:49,065 --> 02:07:51,090
I just come to get me effects.

1313
02:07:52,702 --> 02:07:56,900
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?

1314
02:07:56,973 --> 02:07:59,237
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

1315
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:05,272
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

1316
02:08:05,348 --> 02:08:07,009
I blame the fish people.

1317
02:08:07,083 --> 02:08:11,452
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,

1318
02:08:11,521 --> 02:08:14,752
automatically aren't
as disciplined as non-fish people?

1319
02:08:14,824 --> 02:08:17,190
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.

1320
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:22,163
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

1321
02:08:22,232 --> 02:08:25,668
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

1322
02:08:33,209 --> 02:08:35,234
Prepare to board!

1323
02:08:36,879 --> 02:08:38,073
Cover!

1324
02:08:54,731 --> 02:08:56,460
No!

1325
02:09:22,392 --> 02:09:27,352
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.

1326
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:31,332
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

1327
02:09:32,635 --> 02:09:34,398
To my great regret.

1328
02:09:35,705 --> 02:09:36,831
But...

1329
02:09:39,575 --> 02:09:41,566
...never too late to learn, eh?

1330
02:09:49,752 --> 02:09:51,219
Whoa!

1331
02:09:57,860 --> 02:10:01,193
The chest, hand it over.

1332
02:10:01,264 --> 02:10:03,095
I can set you free, mate.

1333
02:10:03,166 --> 02:10:06,192
My freedom was forfeited long ago.

1334
02:10:53,249 --> 02:10:54,580
Elizabeth.

1335
02:10:58,354 --> 02:10:59,582
Elizabeth.

1336
02:11:00,623 --> 02:11:01,988
Will you marry me?

1337
02:11:03,793 --> 02:11:05,624
I don't think now's the best time.

1338
02:11:09,432 --> 02:11:11,491
Now may be the only time.

1339
02:11:16,706 --> 02:11:17,900
I love you.

1340
02:11:23,846 --> 02:11:26,371
I've made my choice. What's yours?

1341
02:11:27,216 --> 02:11:28,513
Barbossa.

1342
02:11:29,986 --> 02:11:31,419
Marry us.

1343
02:11:32,522 --> 02:11:35,184
I'm a little busy at the moment.

1344
02:11:41,397 --> 02:11:43,388
Barbossa, now.

1345
02:11:45,067 --> 02:11:46,398
Fine, then.

1346
02:11:57,280 --> 02:12:00,408
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...

1347
02:12:01,117 --> 02:12:04,644
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.

1348
02:12:09,525 --> 02:12:12,551
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

1349
02:12:12,628 --> 02:12:14,596
- I do.
- Great.

1350
02:12:21,070 --> 02:12:23,334
Will Turner, do you take me...

1351
02:12:24,607 --> 02:12:26,336
...to be your wife...

1352
02:12:30,746 --> 02:12:32,714
...in sickness and in health...

1353
02:12:33,616 --> 02:12:35,846
...with health being the less likely?

1354
02:12:43,059 --> 02:12:44,287
I do.

1355
02:12:46,562 --> 02:12:49,463
As captain, I now pronounce you...

1356
02:12:52,435 --> 02:12:54,266
You may kiss...

1357
02:13:03,145 --> 02:13:04,578
You may kiss...

1358
02:13:09,552 --> 02:13:11,213
Just kiss.

1359
02:13:49,926 --> 02:13:51,587
Leave it.

1360
02:14:03,839 --> 02:14:06,501
You can do nothing without the key.

1361
02:14:06,576 --> 02:14:08,043
I already have the key.

1362
02:14:09,312 --> 02:14:10,745
No, you don't.

1363
02:14:12,248 --> 02:14:13,545
Oh, that key.

1364
02:14:49,619 --> 02:14:50,608
No!

1365
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:20,171
Oi. My pistol.

1366
02:15:47,877 --> 02:15:49,276
Turner.

1367
02:15:54,283 --> 02:15:55,272
Fire!

1368
02:16:01,223 --> 02:16:02,781
Thank you, Jack.

1369
02:16:32,621 --> 02:16:34,145
Stop! It's me.

1370
02:16:36,659 --> 02:16:39,560
It's Will. Your son.

1371
02:17:08,357 --> 02:17:09,722
Ha!

1372
02:17:40,689 --> 02:17:42,156
Go!

1373
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:04,637
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

1374
02:18:04,713 --> 02:18:07,045
That's why I brought this.

1375
02:18:26,468 --> 02:18:29,699
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

1376
02:18:38,314 --> 02:18:39,645
Missed.

1377
02:18:40,850 --> 02:18:45,719
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.

1378
02:19:02,271 --> 02:19:05,570
Ah. Love.

1379
02:19:05,941 --> 02:19:09,433
A dreadful bond.

1380
02:19:10,212 --> 02:19:15,206
And yet, so easily severed.

1381
02:19:15,284 --> 02:19:20,483
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

1382
02:19:20,556 --> 02:19:21,989
Do you?

1383
02:19:32,735 --> 02:19:36,432
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

1384
02:19:37,039 --> 02:19:41,442
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

1385
02:19:42,311 --> 02:19:44,745
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

1386
02:19:45,314 --> 02:19:46,872
Is it?

1387
02:20:12,641 --> 02:20:13,767
Will?

1388
02:20:15,377 --> 02:20:17,971
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

1389
02:20:23,852 --> 02:20:25,513
William?

1390
02:20:25,955 --> 02:20:27,650
My son.

1391
02:20:39,535 --> 02:20:43,027
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!

1392
02:20:46,742 --> 02:20:50,644
You will not forestall my judgment.

1393
02:21:06,428 --> 02:21:08,089
Calypso.

1394
02:21:13,936 --> 02:21:19,397
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!

1395
02:21:50,372 --> 02:21:51,430
No.

1396
02:21:55,544 --> 02:21:57,034
No, no.

1397
02:21:57,112 --> 02:21:58,841
No!

1398
02:22:00,115 --> 02:22:04,415
Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1399
02:22:04,486 --> 02:22:07,978
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1400
02:22:08,057 --> 02:22:10,082
Don't leave me.

1401
02:22:11,393 --> 02:22:13,088
Don't. No!

1402
02:22:13,162 --> 02:22:15,027
I won't leave you.

1403
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:27,335
The Dutchman must have a captain.

1404
02:22:30,679 --> 02:22:32,670
Hold on.

1405
02:23:26,401 --> 02:23:28,062
Thank goodness, Jack.

1406
02:23:28,137 --> 02:23:32,096
The armada's still out there. The
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard,

1407
02:23:32,174 --> 02:23:36,270
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1408
02:23:36,345 --> 02:23:38,973
Never actually been one for tradition.

1409
02:23:43,952 --> 02:23:46,978
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

1410
02:23:47,055 --> 02:23:49,319
Belay that,
or we'll be a sitting duck.

1411
02:23:49,391 --> 02:23:50,722
Belay that "belay that."

1412
02:23:50,792 --> 02:23:52,555
- But the arma...
- Belay.

1413
02:23:52,661 --> 02:23:54,925
- The Endeav...
- Stow. Shut it.

1414
02:24:08,010 --> 02:24:10,035
What are they waiting for?

1415
02:24:11,013 --> 02:24:13,982
He expects us to honor our agreement.

1416
02:24:16,151 --> 02:24:18,984
Ready guns and gun ports.

1417
02:24:22,724 --> 02:24:27,627
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

1418
02:24:54,489 --> 02:24:56,980
Ah, she survived.

1419
02:25:22,117 --> 02:25:25,484
- Ready on the guns.
- Guns ready.

1420
02:25:26,121 --> 02:25:28,282
Full canvas.

1421
02:25:28,357 --> 02:25:30,723
Aye, full canvas.

1422
02:25:55,250 --> 02:25:56,547
Orders, sir.

1423
02:26:00,022 --> 02:26:01,148
Sir!

1424
02:26:01,790 --> 02:26:02,779
Cap'n.

1425
02:26:03,225 --> 02:26:05,853
- Fire.
- Fire!

1426
02:26:05,927 --> 02:26:07,986
- Fire!
- Fire!

1427
02:26:08,063 --> 02:26:10,031
Fire, all!

1428
02:26:20,609 --> 02:26:23,510
Orders? Orders, sir?

1429
02:26:35,891 --> 02:26:37,358
Sir, what do you command?

1430
02:26:37,993 --> 02:26:39,324
It's just...

1431
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:43,125
...good business.

1432
02:26:44,833 --> 02:26:46,164
Abandon ship!

1433
02:26:46,234 --> 02:26:50,261
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

1434
02:28:16,024 --> 02:28:17,753
They're turning away!

1435
02:28:30,105 --> 02:28:31,970
Wind in your sails.

1436
02:28:37,212 --> 02:28:39,271
Shiver me timbers.

1437
02:29:00,268 --> 02:29:02,327
Captain Turner!

1438
02:29:16,985 --> 02:29:19,078
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Cap'n?

1439
02:29:20,288 --> 02:29:23,280
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

1440
02:29:23,358 --> 02:29:25,053
Hooray!

1441
02:29:27,295 --> 02:29:29,058
Now go and get it.

1442
02:29:47,482 --> 02:29:49,074
Orders, sir?

1443
02:29:53,355 --> 02:29:57,382
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman. You're free.

1444
02:29:57,459 --> 02:29:59,450
Aye.

1445
02:29:59,528 --> 02:30:01,928
That's a fine thing, but...

1446
02:30:03,532 --> 02:30:08,231
...by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

1447
02:30:08,303 --> 02:30:09,895
If you'll have me.

1448
02:30:13,942 --> 02:30:15,807
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.

1449
02:30:17,178 --> 02:30:19,169
Aye, Captain Turner.

1450
02:30:34,129 --> 02:30:36,791
This ship
has a purpose again.

1451
02:30:36,865 --> 02:30:38,890
And where we are bound...

1452
02:30:39,568 --> 02:30:42,036
...she cannot come.

1453
02:30:42,103 --> 02:30:44,071
One day ashore.

1454
02:30:44,139 --> 02:30:46,232
Ten years at sea.

1455
02:30:47,208 --> 02:30:50,041
That's a steep price
for what's been done.

1456
02:30:52,213 --> 02:30:54,204
Depends on the one day.

1457
02:30:56,985 --> 02:30:59,545
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

1458
02:31:03,358 --> 02:31:05,349
The oars are inside.

1459
02:31:16,972 --> 02:31:18,940
Mrs. Turner.

1460
02:31:23,845 --> 02:31:25,403
Goodbye, poppet.

1461
02:31:31,219 --> 02:31:32,516
Jack.

1462
02:31:33,755 --> 02:31:36,280
It would never
have worked out between us.

1463
02:31:39,628 --> 02:31:42,096
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

1464
02:31:45,533 --> 02:31:47,398
Once was quite enough.

1465
02:31:49,804 --> 02:31:51,795
Thank you.

1466
02:32:11,126 --> 02:32:13,117
I'm going to need the other one.

1467
02:32:45,126 --> 02:32:47,117
It's nearly sunset.

1468
02:33:06,281 --> 02:33:07,976
It's always belonged to you.

1469
02:33:13,755 --> 02:33:15,313
Will you keep it safe?

1470
02:33:17,125 --> 02:33:18,285
Yes.

1471
02:33:22,297 --> 02:33:23,389
Yes.

1472
02:33:43,318 --> 02:33:44,307
Will!

1473
02:33:59,901 --> 02:34:02,062
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

1474
02:34:30,932 --> 02:34:34,231
Granted it tends to list to port,
and has been, on occasion,

1475
02:34:34,302 --> 02:34:36,532
known to frighten young women.

1476
02:34:36,604 --> 02:34:40,973
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

1477
02:34:41,676 --> 02:34:42,802
Is that it?

1478
02:34:43,411 --> 02:34:44,935
The Black Pearl.

1479
02:34:45,580 --> 02:34:47,673
It's not very big.

1480
02:34:47,749 --> 02:34:50,149
Love, that is a dinghy.

1481
02:34:50,218 --> 02:34:55,588
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish and...

1482
02:34:56,057 --> 02:34:59,185
...gone. Why is it gone?

1483
02:35:00,128 --> 02:35:01,720
Is that it there?

1484
02:35:02,931 --> 02:35:04,057
Yes, there it is.

1485
02:35:05,066 --> 02:35:06,294
Why is it there?

1486
02:35:07,669 --> 02:35:09,227
It's much larger up close.

1487
02:35:09,304 --> 02:35:11,670
Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.

1488
02:35:11,739 --> 02:35:15,675
- I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?

1489
02:35:15,743 --> 02:35:18,337
- Not what he said.
- I never!

1490
02:35:20,148 --> 02:35:24,278
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

1491
02:35:24,352 --> 02:35:27,185
The ship? We're on the ship.

1492
02:35:29,824 --> 02:35:32,691
Jack! The ship's gone!

1493
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:33,818
Really?

1494
02:35:35,864 --> 02:35:39,129
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

1495
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:42,567
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.

1496
02:35:42,637 --> 02:35:44,127
No, I don't love you.

1497
02:35:44,205 --> 02:35:47,299
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

1498
02:35:47,375 --> 02:35:50,105
It is pronounced "egregious."

1499
02:35:50,178 --> 02:35:54,205
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

1500
02:35:54,282 --> 02:35:56,978
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance

1501
02:35:57,051 --> 02:36:00,782
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Savvy?

1502
02:36:13,334 --> 02:36:16,269
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

1503
02:36:20,174 --> 02:36:24,201
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?

1504
02:36:24,279 --> 02:36:25,371
Sea turtles?

1505
02:36:25,647 --> 02:36:27,877
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...

1506
02:36:27,949 --> 02:36:30,611
All men up the ratlines.

1507
02:36:31,019 --> 02:36:33,817
All men up the ratlines!

1508
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:41,190
Oh, you want a taste of this?

1509
02:36:42,697 --> 02:36:45,894
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.

1510
02:36:45,967 --> 02:36:48,595
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.

1511
02:36:48,670 --> 02:36:49,659
Sir?

1512
02:36:51,039 --> 02:36:53,564
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled

1513
02:36:53,641 --> 02:36:56,132
- about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.

1514
02:36:56,277 --> 02:36:59,178
- Again.
- Is that so?

1515
02:36:59,447 --> 02:37:03,110
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

1516
02:37:03,184 --> 02:37:05,880
if we could see that item
you told us about.

1517
02:37:05,954 --> 02:37:08,115
- On the charts.
- Aye.

1518
02:37:08,222 --> 02:37:09,621
With our own eyes.

1519
02:37:09,691 --> 02:37:13,286
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.

1520
02:37:13,728 --> 02:37:15,559
Ah.

1521
02:37:15,630 --> 02:37:17,860
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

1522
02:37:18,266 --> 02:37:20,791
There's more than one way
to live forever.

1523
02:37:20,868 --> 02:37:24,599
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

1524
02:37:35,383 --> 02:37:37,248
