1
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,743
Will you take a look at that?

2
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,202
Pretty pathetic, huh?

3
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,787
Well, you'll never believe this,

4
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,041
but that llama you're looking at
was once a human being.

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,709
And not just any human being.

6
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,210
That guy was an emperor.

7
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,337
A rich, powerful ball of charisma.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,714
Oh, yeah!

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,633
This is his story.

10
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,552
Well, actually my story.

11
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,889
That's right. I'm that llama.

12
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,391
The name is Kuzco...

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,852
Emperor Kuzco.

14
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,731
I was the world's nicest guy,
and they ruined my life for no reason.

15
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,066
Is that hard to believe?

16
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,318
Look, I tell you what.
You go back aways...

17
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,404
You know, before I was a llama,
and this will all make sense.

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,407
All right, now see,
that's a little too far back.

19
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,576
Look at me!

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,078
That's me as a baby.

21
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,374
All right, let's move ahead.

22
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,602
Yeah.

23
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,604
There are despots and dictators

24
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,148
Political manipulators

25
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,486
There are blue bloods
with the intellects of fleas

26
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,613
There are kings and catty tyrants

27
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,825
Who are so lacking in refinements

28
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,744
They'd be better suited
swinging from the trees

29
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,455
He was born and raised to rule

30
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,125
No one has ever been as cool

31
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,419
In a thousand years of aristocracy

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,965
An enigma and a mystery

33
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,008
In Mesoamerican history

34
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,637
The quintessence
of perfection that is he

35
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,432
Okay, this is the real me. Not this.

36
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,892
This. Not this.

37
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,477
Winner! Loser.

38
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,314
Okay, see this palace?
Everyone in it is at my command.

39
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,774
Check this out.

40
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,526
Butler.

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,986
Chef.

42
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,988
Theme song guy.

43
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,656
Yeah!

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,658
He's the sovereign lord of the nation

45
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,286
He's the hippest cat in creation

46
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,330
He's the alpha, the omega, A to Z

47
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,876
And this perfect world will spin

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,128
Around his every little whim

49
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,006
'Cause this perfect world
begins and ends with

50
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,048
Me.

51
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,175
What's his name?

52
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,636
Kuzco

53
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,013
That's his name

54
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,806
Kuzco

55
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,933
He's the king of the world

56
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,019
Kuzco

57
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,854
Is he hip or what?

58
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,814
Kuzco

59
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,524
Yeah

60
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,322
You threw off my groove!

61
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,617
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off
the emperor's groove.

62
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,536
Sorry!

63
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,538
You were saying?

64
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,124
What's his name?
Kuzco

65
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,628
Kuzco

66
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,842
That's his name

67
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,721
Is he hip or what?

68
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,267
Don't you know
he's the king of the world?

69
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,605
Yeah

70
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,444
Boom, baby!

71
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,739
Your Highness,
it is time for you to choose your bride.

72
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,241
All righty.

73
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,825
Trot out the ladies.

74
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,994
Let's take a look-see.

75
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,497
Hate your hair. Not likely.

76
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,253
And let me guess.
You have a great personality.

77
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,088
Is this really the best you could do?

78
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,924
Yes. Oh, no. I mean, perhaps...

79
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,926
What is he babbling about?

80
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,262
He's like the thing
that wouldn't shut up.

81
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,057
Anyway, still wondering
about that llama in the opening?

82
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,644
Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life.

83
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,773
First, there's Pacha.

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,734
Excuse me.
I'm here to see Emperor Kuzco.

85
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,319
You see, I got this summons...

86
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,156
Inside, up the stairs, and to the left.
Just follow the signs.

87
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,034
Great. Thanks a lot.

88
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,372
And don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look.

89
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,792
Pardon me. That's mine.

90
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,918
Here you go.

91
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

92
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,048
Hey. Are you all right? Here. Let me...

93
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,009
- You're so very kind.
- What happened?

94
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,220
Well, I threw off the emperor's groove.

95
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,430
- What?
- His groove!

96
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,182
The rhythm in which he lives his life,
his pattern of behavior.

97
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,309
I threw it off,

98
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,811
and the emperor had me
thrown out the window.

99
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,814
Really? I'm supposed to see him today.

100
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,691
Don't throw off his groove!

101
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,775
Okay.

102
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,319
Beware the groove.

103
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,820
Hey, are you gonna be all right?

104
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,488
Groove.

105
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,574
You see what I mean?

106
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,327
This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is,

107
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,786
he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next.

108
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,998
And why have you come here today?

109
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,543
Well... Your Highness...
I mean, Your Grace.

110
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,338
Okay, gang.
Check out this piece of work.

111
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,674
This is Yzma, the emperor's advisor,

112
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,344
living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth.

113
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,763
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man.

114
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,848
Every decade or so
she gets a new one.

115
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,808
This year's model is called Kronk.

116
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,854
Yeah, I got that there, Yzma.

117
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,525
Yep, that's Kronk.

118
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,445
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit

119
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,073
of trying to run the country
behind my back,

120
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,158
and I'm thinkin' that's got to stop.

121
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,495
It is no concern of mine
whether your family has...

122
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,704
What was it again?

123
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,414
Food.

124
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,210
You really should have thought of that
before you became peasants.

125
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,713
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!

126
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,216
But I... Okay.

127
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,347
The nerve of some of those peasants?

128
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,932
Tell me about it.

129
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,475
Hi there.

130
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,435
Your Highness.

131
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,232
You were doing it again.

132
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,235
Doing? Doing... Doing what?

133
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,569
Doing my job.

134
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,489
I'm the emperor,
and you're the emperor's advisor.

135
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,324
- Remember that?
- But, Your Highness,

136
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,035
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

137
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,122
Look at these wrinkles.

138
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,417
What is holding this woman together?

139
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,754
What the...
How long has that been there?

140
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,090
Good thinkin', Yzma.
What do you say, Kuzco?

141
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,716
No touchy!

142
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,593
No touchy. No touch.

143
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,304
Excuse me, Your Highness.
The village leader is here to see you.

144
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,931
Great. Send him in.

145
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,641
And by the way, you're fired.

146
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,143
Fired?

147
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,395
What do you mean, fired?

148
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,896
How else can I say it?

149
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,566
You're being let go,
your department's being downsized,

150
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,152
you're part of an outplacement,
we're going in a different direction,

151
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,196
we're not picking up your option...
Take your pick. I got more.

152
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,657
But I... You...

153
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,952
But... But, Your Highness,

154
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,663
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

155
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,875
for many, many years.

156
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,752
Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride.

157
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,046
You just hit yours 50 years ago.

158
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,800
So, who's in my chair?

159
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,469
I know! Yzma.

160
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,970
Yzma's in your chair, right?

161
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,764
Very good, Kronk. Here. Get the snack.

162
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,016
Got it!

163
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,978
Okay, you heard the man. Up, up, up.

164
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,189
I'm okay. I'm fine.

165
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,445
Okay. Show him in.

166
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,533
Afternoon, Your Highness.

167
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,327
I'm here
because I received a summons...

168
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,455
Hey, there he is! My main village man.

169
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,123
Pacha.

170
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,583
Anyway, I got this summons...

171
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,376
Pacha.

172
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,338
That's right.
You are just the man I wanted to see.

173
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,506
I am?

174
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,091
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

175
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,513
You can fix my problem, can't you?

176
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,515
Sure. I'll do what I can.

177
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,100
Good, good.
That's just what I wanted to hear.

178
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,521
Are you aware of just how important
your village is to the empire?

179
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,857
Well, I know we grow the crops
that you use here at the palace.

180
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,776
We also herd the llamas that you...

181
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,280
My village?

182
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,490
Yeah.

183
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,827
You got a pretty sweet little setup there
on top of that hill, don't you?

184
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,374
Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop
for the last six generations.

185
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:08,129
So tell me, where do you find
you get the most sun?

186
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,509
I'd say just on the other side
of those trees.

187
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:17,222
When the sun hits that ridge just right,
these hills sing.

188
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,765
Well, that settles it.

189
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,725
- Really?
- Yep. Problem solved.

190
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,060
Thanks for coming.

191
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,646
That's it? That's all you wanted me for?

192
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,483
I just needed an insider's opinion
before I okay'd this spot for my pool.

193
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,528
Your pool?

194
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,197
Welcome to Kuzcotopia,

195
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,909
my ultimate summer getaway
complete with water slide.

196
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,120
- What?
- Isn't it great?

197
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,497
It's my birthday gift to me.

198
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,249
I'm so happy.

199
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,504
I don't understand
how this could happen.

200
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,131
Well, let me clear it up for you.

201
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,426
At my birthday celebration tomorrow,
I give the word,

202
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,386
and your town will be destroyed

203
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,763
to make way for this...

204
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,271
So, if I were you, I'd pick up some
change-of-address forms

205
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,314
on the way home.

206
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,774
But, where will we live?

207
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,362
Don't know, don't care. How's that?

208
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,114
But wait. You can't...

209
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,745
When I give the word,

210
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,956
your little town thingy will be bye-bye.

211
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,791
Bye-bye!

212
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,793
Wait. No...

213
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,797
Yeah. Everything was goin' my way.

214
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,967
Or so I thought.

215
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,093
He can't get rid of me that easily.

216
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:42,223
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is?

217
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,934
Does he... A little to the left.

218
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,813
Have any idea of who he's dealing with?

219
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,983
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.

220
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,236
Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.

221
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,863
Yeah, go figure.

222
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,865
Well, it's better
you're takin' out your anger

223
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,950
on these things instead
of the real Kuzco?

224
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,245
That's it, Kronk! That's it!

225
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,456
I'll get rid of Kuzco.

226
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,167
The real Kuzco?

227
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,670
Of course the real Kuzco.

228
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,505
Don't you see? It's perfect.

229
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,049
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne,

230
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,678
I'll take over and rule the empire.

231
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,179
Brilliant!

232
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,890
So how does that work
with you bein' fired and all?

233
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,685
The only ones who know
about that are the three of us,

234
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,353
soon to be the two of us.

235
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,979
And I'm one of those two, right?

236
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,022
To the secret lab!

237
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,236
Pull the lever, Kronk.

238
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,696
Wrong lever!

239
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,283
Why do we even have that lever?

240
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,453
Get out of my way!

241
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,623
Please remain seated

242
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,834
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times.

243
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,795
Faster, faster!

244
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,381
Yzma, put your hands in the air!

245
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,849
How shall I do it?

246
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,851
I know.

247
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,728
I'll turn him into a flea,

248
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,438
a harmless little flea,

249
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,398
and then I'll put that flea in a box,

250
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,316
and then I'll put that box
inside of another box,

251
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,277
and then I'll mail that box to myself,

252
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,571
and when it arrives...

253
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,406
I'll smash it with a hammer!

254
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,868
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!

255
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,952
Genius, I say!

256
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,792
Or, to save on postage,

257
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,794
I'll just poison him with this.

258
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,255
Take it, Kronk.

259
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,174
Feel the power.

260
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,176
I can feel it.

261
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,386
Our moment of triumph approaches.

262
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,098
It's dinner time.

263
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,527
So, is everything ready for tonight?

264
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,113
Yeah. I thought we'd start off
with soup and a light salad

265
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,615
and then see how we feel after that.

266
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,909
Not the dinner...

267
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,243
The you-know...

268
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,496
Right. The poison...

269
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,789
The poison for Kuzco,

270
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,208
the poison chosen
specially to kill Kuzco,

271
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,542
Kuzco's poison.

272
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,712
- That poison?
- Yes! That poison.

273
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,922
Got you covered.

274
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,131
Excellent.

275
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,468
A few drops in his drink,
then I'll propose a toast,

276
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,637
and he will be dead before dessert.

277
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,431
Which is a real shame,
because it's gonna be delicious.

278
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,308
Boom, bam, baby!

279
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,726
Let's get to the grub.

280
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,687
I am one hungry king of the world.

281
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,650
So, no hard feelings about being let go?

282
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,361
None whatsoever.

283
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,532
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.

284
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,535
Drink. Right.

285
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,010
Your Highness.

286
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,638
Is something burning?

287
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,390
My spinach puffs!

288
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,817
So, he seems nice.

289
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,069
He is.

290
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,532
He's what, in his late 20s?

291
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,118
I'm not sure.

292
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,536
Saved 'em!

293
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,704
- That's great.
- Great!

294
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,955
- Good job.
- Very good job.

295
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,790
Watch it. They're still hot.

296
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,339
Kronk. The emperor needs his drink.

297
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,260
Right. Right.

298
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,061
Hey, Kronky,
everything okay back there?

299
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,354
Well...

300
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,860
The drinks were a bit on the...

301
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,322
Warm side.

302
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,701
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.

303
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,411
Yes, Kronk.

304
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,746
Riveting.

305
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,081
A toast to the emperor!

306
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,876
Long live Kuzco!

307
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,253
Don't drink the wine.

308
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,755
Poison.

309
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,763
Tasty.

310
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,974
Finally!

311
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,559
Good work, Kronk.

312
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,770
They're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.

313
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,064
Now to get rid of the body.

314
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,275
Okay! What were we saying?

315
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,612
We were just making a toast

316
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,947
to your long and...

317
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,867
Healthy rule.

318
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,536
Right. So what are you gonna do?

319
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,997
I mean, you've been
around here a long time,

320
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,999
and I really mean a long time.

321
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,129
It might be difficult
for someone of your age

322
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,090
adjusting to life in the private sector.

323
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,969
Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal?
Be a friend?

324
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,388
Now, about you finding new work...

325
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,973
Hit him on the head.

326
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,599
That's gonna be tough.

327
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,850
More broccoli?

328
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,602
Because you're... You know.

329
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,980
Let's face it. You're no spring chicken,

330
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,273
and I mean that
in the best possible way.

331
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,819
What? A llama?

332
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,862
He's supposed to be dead!

333
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,656
Yeah, weird.

334
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,993
Let me see that vial.

335
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,622
This isn't poison.

336
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,959
This is extract of llama.

337
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,337
You know, in my defense,
your poisons all look alike.

338
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,631
You might think about
relabeling some of them.

339
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,260
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

340
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,846
What about dinner?

341
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,349
Kronk, this is kind of important.

342
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,518
How about dessert?

343
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,187
Well, I suppose there's time for dessert.

344
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,814
And coffee?

345
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,858
All right. A quick cup of coffee.

346
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,986
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

347
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,202
Guess where I am right now.

348
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,538
In the bag.

349
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,958
Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.

350
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,543
Hey!

351
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,422
He's doing his own theme music?

352
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,100
Big, dumb, and tone deaf.

353
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,853
I am so glad
I was unconscious for all of this.

354
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,400
Mission accomplished.

355
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,331
You're not just gonna let him
die like that, are you?

356
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,041
My shoulder angel.

357
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,709
Don't listen to that guy.

358
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,213
He's trying to lead you
down the path of righteousness.

359
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,091
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

360
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,218
- Come off it.
- You come off it!

361
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,302
- You.
- You.

362
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,637
- You.
- You infinity.

363
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,890
Listen up, big guy.

364
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,559
I got three good reasons why
you should just walk away.

365
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,436
Number one... Look at that guy!

366
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,772
He's got that sissy stringy music thing.

367
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,650
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.

368
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,111
Right. That's a harp...

369
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,320
And that's a dress.

370
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,655
Robe!

371
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,281
Reason number 2.

372
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,616
Look what I can do.

373
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,619
But, what does that
have to do with anything?

374
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,788
No, no. He's got a point.

375
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,289
Listen, you guys.

376
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,167
You're sort of confusing me, so begone!

377
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,337
Uh, or, you know.
However I get rid of you guys.

378
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,131
That'll work.

379
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,320
What's with the chimp and the bug?

380
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,822
Can we get back to me?

381
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,118
Oh, boy. Think, think, think.

382
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,329
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?

383
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,087
What am I gonna tell the village?

384
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,674
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. Okay.

385
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,384
What do I do? What do I do?

386
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,391
Back! Elbow! Shoulder!

387
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,986
Hey! Hey, you!
Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me.

388
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,155
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

389
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,948
Comin' through. Hey, you with the cart!

390
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,203
This is not good.

391
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,539
Hope that doesn't come back
to haunt me.

392
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,593
Mom, Mom! I think I'm still growing!

393
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,844
Measure me again!

394
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,764
All right, Tipo. Stand still and let's see.

395
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,558
Mom, you and I both know
that it's impossible for him

396
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,602
to have grown in the last five minutes.

397
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,063
Isn't it?

398
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,107
Look how much you've grown!

399
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,652
What? Tipo, get out of the way.
It's my turn again. Measure me.

400
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,654
Dad's home!

401
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,448
Hey!

402
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,118
Come here.

403
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,664
Dad! I ate a bug today!

404
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,791
Was Mom baking again?

405
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,001
Don't tell her I said that.

406
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,460
I heard that.

407
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,254
Okay, everybody, move aside.

408
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,006
Lady with a baby comin' through.

409
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,801
Dad, Dad, Dad! Look at how big I am!

410
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,428
We were all measured today.

411
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,888
I'm going through a growth spurt.

412
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,057
I'm as big as you were
when you were me.

413
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,559
Sure are.

414
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,478
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

415
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,732
Okay, okay, you two.

416
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,818
Our deal was that you could stay awake
until Daddy came home.

417
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,695
Now say good night.

418
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,989
Dad, do we have to?

419
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,536
No, you two can stay up.

420
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,455
We're just gonna be sittin'
here tellin' each other

421
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,165
how much we love each other.

422
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,499
Right, honey?

423
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,753
Good night.

424
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,797
So what did the emperor want?

425
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,884
You know what? He couldn't see me.

426
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,345
- Couldn't see you? Why not?
- I don't know.

427
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,888
Well, that's just rude.

428
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,140
Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.

429
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,224
No, no, no, no. No.

430
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,977
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

431
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,187
Honey...

432
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,730
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

433
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,273
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

434
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,359
Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.

435
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,028
Pacha, I'm fine.
This baby's not coming for a while,

436
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,281
but even if it was,
I'd give that guy a piece of my mind.

437
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,200
That kind of behavior just...

438
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,120
I gotta go wash something.

439
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,013
Pacha? You okay?

440
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,642
Yeah. I'm just a little tired from the trip.

441
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,562
I'm gonna go put Misty away.

442
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,910
Hi. Excuse me.

443
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,078
Two seconds here.

444
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,080
I'm the one in the cart. Remember?

445
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,791
This story's about me, not him.

446
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,584
Okay. You got it? All right.

447
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,628
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.

448
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,023
Where'd you come from, little guy?

449
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,817
No touchy.

450
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,777
Demon llama!

451
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,279
Demon llama? Where?

452
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,368
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

453
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,037
My head.

454
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,416
Okay, demon llama. Just take it easy.

455
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,294
I mean you no harm.

456
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,004
What are you talking about...

457
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,298
Wait. I know you.

458
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,966
You're that whiny peasant.

459
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,719
Emperor Kuzco?

460
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,762
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

461
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,515
How did...

462
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,643
You don't...

463
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,270
Look like the emperor.

464
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,314
What do you mean
I don't look like the emperor?

465
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,858
Do this...

466
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,278
What is this, some kind of little game
you country folk like to...

467
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,864
It can't be!

468
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,161
My face! My beautiful, beautiful face!

469
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,330
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I'm an ugly, stinky llama!

470
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,873
Wait, okay, Your Majesty.

471
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,333
Llama face!

472
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,168
What happened?

473
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,338
I'm tryin' to figure that out, okay?

474
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,969
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.

475
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,304
Wait a minute.

476
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,805
I remember you.

477
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,266
I remember telling you
that I was building my pool

478
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,394
where your house was,
and then you got mad at me.

479
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,023
And you turned me into a llama!

480
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,025
What? No, I did not.

481
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,818
Yes, and then you kidnapped me.

482
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,362
Why would I kidnap a llama?

483
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,532
I have no idea.
You're the criminal mastermind, not me.

484
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,033
What?

485
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,620
You're right.
That's giving you way too much credit.

486
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,456
Okay. I have to get back to the palace.

487
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,751
Yzma's got that "secret lab. "

488
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,712
I'll just snap my fingers
and order her to change me back.

489
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,590
Hey, you. No time to waste. Let's go.

490
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,722
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body.
Wouldn't you? Now let's go.

491
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,727
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

492
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,647
You want to run that by me again?

493
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,569
I can't let you go back
unless you change your mind

494
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,238
and build your summer
home somewhere else.

495
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,493
I got a little secret for you.
Come here. No, closer.

496
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,705
I don't make deals with peasants!

497
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,041
Then I guess I can't take you back.

498
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,751
Fine. I don't need you.

499
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,461
I can find my own way back.

500
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,754
I wouldn't recommend it.

501
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,048
It's a little dangerous
if you don't know the way.

502
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,341
Nice try, pal.

503
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,761
No, really. I'm telling you,
there are jaguars and snakes

504
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,597
- and quicksand.
- I'm not listening.

505
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,891
I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.

506
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,770
Still not listening.

507
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,439
You...

508
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,107
Fine. Fine.

509
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,483
Go ahead!

510
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,654
If there's no Kuzco,
there's no Kuzcotopia.

511
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,448
Takes care of my problem.

512
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,298
Scary jungle. Right.

513
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,885
A leaf. It might attack me.

514
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,804
It's a scary tree. I'm afraid.

515
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,643
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such,

516
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,479
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

517
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,815
Okay, where am I?

518
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,153
What...

519
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,322
Help me! Help me!

520
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,990
Help me!

521
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,869
Too late.

522
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,331
Okay, that was the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

523
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,257
What do you want?

524
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,094
For me?

525
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,970
Why, I don't know what to say.

526
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,016
Hit the road, Bucky.

527
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,790
No, no. No, no, no, no.

528
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,917
No, no. No, don't.

529
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,888
No!

530
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,993
You killer jaguars...

531
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,272
Don't worry, Your Highness. I gotcha.
You're safe now.

532
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,528
Maybe I'm just new
to this whole rescuing thing,

533
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,113
but this, to me,

534
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,240
might be considered
kind of a step backwards,

535
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,493
- wouldn't you say?
- No, no, no. It's okay.

536
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,827
This is all right.

537
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,454
We can figure this out.

538
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,540
I hate you.

539
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,628
No!

540
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,487
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting all funned out.

541
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,991
Don't tell me.
We're about to go over a huge waterfall.

542
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,827
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?

543
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,453
Most likely.

544
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,538
Bring it on.

545
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,363
Your Highness.

546
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,115
Your Highness, can you hear me?

547
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,243
Oh, boy. Come on, breathe.

548
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,954
Breathe!

549
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,707
Why me?

550
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,508
All right.

551
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,149
For the last time, it was not a kiss.

552
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,401
Well, whatever you call it...

553
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,362
It was disgusting.

554
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,115
And if you would've done what
I ordered you to do in the first place,

555
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,327
we all could've been spared
your little kiss of life.

556
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,374
But now that you're here,
you will take me back to the palace.

557
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,959
I'll have Yzma change me back,

558
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,046
and then I'll start construction
on Kuzcotopia.

559
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,213
Yeah.

560
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,759
Okay, now, look,
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.

561
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,846
I just think if you really thought about it,

562
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,432
you'd decide to build your home
on a different hilltop.

563
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,975
And why would I do that?

564
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,020
Because...

565
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,563
Deep down, I think you'll realize

566
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,233
that you're forcing an entire village
out of their homes just for you.

567
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,319
And that's...

568
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,987
Bad?

569
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,447
Well, yeah.

570
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,909
Nobody's that heartless.

571
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,454
Now take me back.

572
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,082
What? Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?

573
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,084
All you care about
is building your summer home

574
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,710
and filling it with stuff for you.

575
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,712
Yeah. Me.

576
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,714
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.

577
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,133
You're the only one that doesn't
seem to be with the program,

578
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,802
Pacha?

579
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,972
You know what? Someday,
you're going to wind up all alone,

580
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,265
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

581
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,601
Thanks for that. I'll log that away.

582
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,438
Now, for the final time, I order you
to take me back to the palace.

583
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,316
Looks to me like you're stuck out here,

584
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,111
because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

585
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,075
Because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

586
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,952
Me, me, me.

587
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,999
What? I didn't do anything. I didn't...

588
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,792
Somebody's throwing stuff.

589
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,752
You going to build a fire or what?
What's going on?

590
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,172
He's never going to change his mind.

591
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,844
How am I ever going to get out of here?

592
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,707
And so, it is with great sadness

593
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:09,463
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince...

594
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,841
Taken from us so tragically

595
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,844
on the very eve of his 18th birthday.

596
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,179
Poor little guy.

597
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,473
His legacy will live on in our hearts...

598
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,766
He never had a chance.

599
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,809
For all eternity.

600
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,522
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.

601
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,024
Back to work.

602
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,705
Kronk, darlin',

603
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,085
I must admit you had me worried
when you mixed up those poisons,

604
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,547
but now that Kuzco is dead,
all is forgiven.

605
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,299
Yeah, yeah. He's...

606
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,510
He's dead, all right.

607
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,639
I mean, you can't get much deader
than he is right now.

608
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,432
Unless, of course, we killed him again.

609
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,560
I suppose.

610
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,938
Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.

611
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,774
Kronk...

612
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,442
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.

613
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,568
Kronk...

614
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,654
I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.

615
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,616
Kuzco is dead, right?

616
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,118
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

617
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,496
I need to hear these words.

618
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,915
Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

619
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,959
He's still alive?

620
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,294
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

621
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,963
Kronk...

622
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,383
I just thought I'd give you the heads-up
in case Kuzco ever came back.

623
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,135
He can't come back!

624
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,305
Yeah. That would be kind of awkward,
especially after that lovely eulogy.

625
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,849
You think?

626
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,853
You and I are going out to find him.
If he talks, we are through!

627
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,646
Now let's move!

628
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,815
Dad, look out!

629
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,817
Tipo, what is it?

630
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,986
I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log

631
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,865
and was careening out of control
down a raging river of death!

632
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,408
All right, all right, it's okay.

633
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,202
- It was awful!
- It's okay, it's okay. Tipo, calm down.

634
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,829
It was just a dream.

635
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,498
Your dad's fine.
He just went back to see the emperor.

636
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,296
Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.

637
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,463
That's right.

638
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,424
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

639
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,467
Yeah, like that would ever happen.

640
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,178
It could.

641
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,392
Good night, you two.

642
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,476
- Night, Mom!
- Night, Mom!

643
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,949
Hey.

644
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,080
Thanks.

645
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,834
No problem.

646
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,795
Feels like wool.

647
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,214
Yeah.

648
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,506
Alpaca?

649
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,966
Yeah, it is.

650
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,384
Yeah, I thought so.

651
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,054
It's nice.

652
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,680
My wife made it.

653
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,932
She knits?

654
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,683
Crochets.

655
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,977
Crochets? Nice.

656
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,270
Thanks.

657
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,195
So...

658
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,491
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city,

659
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,825
we'd...

660
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,746
I mean, there's lots of hilltops,
and maybe I might, you know...

661
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,081
I might...

662
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,042
Are you saying...

663
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,669
You've changed your mind?

664
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,420
Well, I...

665
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:41,925
Because you know that means you're
doing something nice for someone else.

666
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,760
No, I know that. I know.

667
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,929
And you're all right with that?

668
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,264
Yes.

669
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,604
What?

670
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,734
Don't shake unless you mean it.

671
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,868
All right.

672
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,206
Let's get you back to the palace.

673
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,083
By the way, thanks.

674
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,711
No...

675
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,462
Thank you.

676
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,312
Okay. Once we cross this bridge,
it's only an hour to the palace.

677
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,689
Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.

678
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,815
I believe it.

679
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,150
- What was that?
- Nothing.

680
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,654
Kuzco!

681
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,824
Kuzco!

682
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,492
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!

683
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,163
No. I don't think I will.

684
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,497
You're going to leave me here?

685
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,833
Well, I was going to have
you imprisoned for life,

686
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,543
but I kind of like this better.

687
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,503
I thought you were a changed man.

688
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,757
Come on. I had to say something
to get you to take me back to the city.

689
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,592
So all of it was a lie?

690
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,761
Well, yeah. No, wait.

691
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,931
Yeah, yeah. It all was a lie.

692
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,224
Toodles.

693
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,560
We shook hands on it!

694
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,983
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is...

695
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,651
You need hands.

696
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,488
Okay. Buh-bye.

697
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,283
Are you okay? Are you all right?

698
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,410
Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm all right.

699
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,120
Good!

700
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,164
That's for going back on your promise!

701
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,794
Yeah. That's for kidnapping me
and taking me to your village...

702
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,713
Which I'm still gonna destroy,
by the way.

703
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,048
No touchy.

704
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,760
Why did I risk my life
for a selfish brat like you?

705
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,637
I was always taught that there
was some good in everyone,

706
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,347
but, you proved me wrong.

707
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,600
Now I feel really bad. Bad llama.

708
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,477
I could've let you die
out there in that jungle,

709
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,396
and then all my problems
would be over.

710
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,564
Well, that makes you ugly and stupid.

711
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,066
Let's end this.

712
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,275
Ladies first.

713
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,970
What are we gonna do?

714
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,807
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

715
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,102
We're gonna die! That's it for me!

716
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,771
No, we're not. Calm down.

717
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,024
I have an idea. Give me your arm.

718
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,527
Okay, now the other one.

719
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,698
When I say go, push against my back,

720
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,909
and we'll walk up the hill. Ready?

721
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,035
Go.

722
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,580
You did that on purpose.

723
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,416
No, I didn't!

724
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,961
Now, we're gonna have to work together
to get out of this, so follow my lead.

725
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,212
Ready?

726
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,464
- Right foot.
- Whose right?

727
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,048
Your right or mine?

728
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,383
I don't care. Mine.

729
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,551
Well, why yours?

730
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,802
Okay, your right! Ready?

731
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,472
- Okay, got it.
- Okay, right.

732
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,182
Left. Right.

733
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,101
Look, we're moving!

734
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,689
Don't look down! Now, stay with me.
Stay with me.

735
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,441
Right. Left.

736
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,151
Right. Left.

737
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,153
Right. Left.

738
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,905
Right!

739
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,991
Now what, genius?

740
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,993
Working on it.

741
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,162
Okay, here's the deal.

742
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,373
Stretch out your neck,
and I'll grab the rope.

743
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,210
How do I know you won't let me fall
after you grab the rope?

744
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,338
You're just gonna have to trust me!

745
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,177
You know, it's a good thing
you're not a big, fat guy,

746
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,679
or this would be really difficult.

747
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,766
Almost.

748
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,267
Got it!

749
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,394
It's stuck.

750
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,480
Take your time. No hurry here.

751
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,234
Scorpions!

752
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,527
Kuzco!

753
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,112
Oh, no!

754
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,686
Look out!

755
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,734
Yeah! Look at me and my bad self.

756
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,696
I snatched you right out of the air.

757
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,116
"I'm a crumbly canyon wall,
and I'm taking you with me. "

758
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,576
Well, not today, pal.

759
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,998
You just saved my life.

760
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,585
So?

761
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,919
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

762
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,421
That there is some good in you after all.

763
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,589
- Oh, no.
- Admit it.

764
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,132
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.

765
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,550
I think there is.

766
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,884
Hey, you could've let me fall.

767
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,846
Come on, what's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless.

768
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,059
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.

769
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,687
Right. Sure.

770
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,772
Well, we better get going.

771
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,192
With that bridge out,
it's a four-day walk to the palace.

772
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,695
What?
You mean you're still taking me back?

773
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,238
I shook on it, didn't I?

774
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,908
Well, yeah, but I hope you realize
that doesn't change a thing.

775
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,786
I'm still building Kuzcotopia
when I get back.

776
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,538
Well, four days is a long time.

777
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,457
Who knows?
Maybe you'll change your mind.

778
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,001
Four days.

779
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,919
What are the chances
of you carrying me?

780
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,421
Not good.

781
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,966
No, no, no!

782
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,261
We've searched every village
surrounding the palace

783
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,305
and still no sign of Kuzco.

784
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,557
Where is he?

785
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,725
Kronk!

786
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,809
Kronk here.

787
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,895
I'm getting tired. Pull over.

788
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,313
Sure thing. Kronk out.

789
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,201
Perfect.

790
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,079
These are my best shoes.

791
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,500
I hate this jungle.

792
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,378
Look.

793
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,505
A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

794
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,299
Just one more for exotic bird bingo.

795
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,051
I am loving this.

796
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,520
Get away from me!

797
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,066
Yeah. Tell me about it.

798
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,486
No, no, it's not you.

799
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,780
She's not the easiest person
to get close to.

800
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,865
There's a wall there. Trust me.

801
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,535
Are you talking to that squirrel?

802
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,495
I was a Junior Chipmunk.

803
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,206
I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

804
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,457
Please continue.

805
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,839
Why me? Why me?

806
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,383
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

807
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,260
This poor little guy has had it rough.

808
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,304
Seems a talking llama
gave him a hard time the other day.

809
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,642
A talking llama? Do tell.

810
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,189
He doesn't really want to talk to you.

811
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,400
Well, then you ask him.

812
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,652
I hate being in the middle.

813
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,070
Squeaky,

814
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,822
squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.

815
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,910
Jaguars? No kidding? Brutal.

816
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,754
Could you give us a little room here?

817
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,088
Sorry.

818
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,759
A little bit more, please.

819
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,012
How is this?

820
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,263
Yeah, that's good.

821
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:11,058
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

822
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,311
Squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.

823
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,283
Low blood sugar, huh?

824
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,993
Yeah. It's a curse.

825
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,578
Well, as soon as we get
something to eat,

826
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,288
you're walking the rest of the way.

827
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,596
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut,
home of the mug...

828
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,683
Of meat. What'll it be?

829
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,854
We'll have two specials.
Is that all right, dear?

830
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,106
Whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

831
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,151
We're on our honeymoon.

832
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,654
Bless you for coming out in public.

833
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,490
So that's two specials.

834
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,034
And an onion log. To split.

835
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,333
Ordering! I need two heartburns
and a deep-fried doorstop on table 12!

836
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,338
Okay, so I'll admit this was a good idea.

837
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,341
When will you learn
that all my ideas are good ones?

838
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,467
That's funny,

839
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,845
because I thought you going
into the jungle by yourself,

840
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,513
being chased by jaguars,

841
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,515
lying to me
to take you back to the palace

842
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,850
were all really bad ideas.

843
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,936
Anything sounds bad
when you say it with that attitude.

844
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:41,274
Hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple.

845
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,322
Boy.

846
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,374
Here. Let me get that for you.

847
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,879
Where are you going?

848
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,298
I'm just going to slip into the kitchen
and have a word with the chef.

849
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,883
You're gonna get us thrown out.

850
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:10,511
Please. With this disguise, I'm invisible.

851
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,313
We've been walking around in circles
for who knows how long.

852
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,191
That is the last time
we take directions from a squirrel.

853
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,904
I should have done away with Kuzco
myself when I had the chance.

854
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,909
You really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

855
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,039
I'll get you another one there, Yzma.

856
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,042
You using that fork there, pal?

857
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,376
Hey, don't I know you?

858
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,586
I don't think so.

859
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,922
- Wrestled you in high school?
- Don't remember that.

860
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,340
Metal shop? I got it!

861
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,675
Miss Narca's interpretive dance,
two semesters.

862
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,802
I was usually in the back
because of my weak ankles.

863
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,055
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

864
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,016
I don't think we've ever met,
but I gotta go.

865
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,351
Don't worry. I'll think of it.

866
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,770
Look, all I know is the food looked iffy.

867
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,772
I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

868
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,065
Hey!

869
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,900
So I'm just checking to make sure

870
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,818
you're going to take
the main course up a notch.

871
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,572
Is there anything on this menu
that is not swimming in gravy?

872
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,074
Hang on. I'll go ask the chef.

873
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,283
It's a simple question.

874
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:18,120
Is there or is there not anything edible
on this menu?

875
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,792
Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet!

876
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,920
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

877
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,838
All right, buster, that's it!

878
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,424
You want a special order,
then you make it! I quit!

879
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,509
Yeah, but I...

880
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,304
I try and I try, but there's no respect
for anyone with vision. That's it!

881
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,973
There's just nothing I can do about it!

882
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,391
Please don't go.

883
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,726
Three pork combos,
extra bacon on the side,

884
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,771
two chili cheese samplers,
a basket of liver and onion rings,

885
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,816
a catch of the day,
and a steak cut in the shape of a trout.

886
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,026
You got all that, honey?

887
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,861
Three oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air,

888
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,656
basket of grandma's breakfast,
and change the bull to a gill, got it.

889
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,824
What's going on?

890
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,826
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

891
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,412
What is he doing in there?

892
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,876
- Come on!
- In a minute. I'm still hungry.

893
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,044
No, Kuzco!

894
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,629
Okay, I'll make it simple for you.

895
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,631
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast.

896
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,466
- You got it?
- Can do.

897
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,969
What's taking so long?

898
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,304
- Pickup!
- Kronk! What are you doing?

899
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,682
- Kinda busy here.
- Why am I not surprised?

900
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,975
Your order's up!

901
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,228
Well, while you're at it,

902
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,689
make me the special.
And hold the gravy!

903
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,024
Check. Pickup!

904
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,526
You know what? On second thought,
make my omelet a meat pie.

905
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,694
Meat pie. Check.

906
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,070
Kronk!

907
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,906
Can I order the potatoes as a side dish?

908
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,366
I'll have to charge you full price.

909
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,869
Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

910
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,662
You got it.
Want cheese on those potatoes?

911
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,372
Thank you, Kronk. Cheddar will be fine.

912
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,207
- Cheddar spuds coming up.
- Spuds yes, cheese no.

913
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,251
- Hold the cheese.
- No, I want the cheese.

914
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,461
Cheese me no like.

915
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,628
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!

916
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,796
Come on, make up your mind!

917
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,048
Okay, okay, on second thought...

918
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,591
Make my potatoes a salad.

919
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,859
Excuse me.
You see that woman over there?

920
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,238
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

921
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,745
One, two, three, four...

922
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,081
Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you

923
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,750
We wish it was our birthday
So we could party, too

924
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,211
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true

925
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,422
It's your birthday?

926
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,093
What are you doing?

927
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,886
Look, there's two people
in there looking for you.

928
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,888
- What?
- A big guy and a skinny old woman.

929
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,099
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

930
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,185
- Yeah.
- That's Yzma and Kronk! I'm saved!

931
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,020
Trust me, they're not here to save you.

932
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,605
They'll take me back to the palace.

933
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,315
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.

934
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,441
I can take it from here.

935
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,194
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

936
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,904
Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.

937
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,241
- No. I can't let you!
- What? Wha...

938
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,326
I get it!

939
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,537
You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

940
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,956
You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.

941
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,165
No!

942
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,708
This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.

943
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,127
Will you just listen to me...

944
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,588
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is your stupid hilltop!

945
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,714
What?

946
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,967
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.

947
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,051
- Go!
- But...

948
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,220
Go on! Get outta here!

949
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,721
Fine!

950
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,351
- This entire mess is all your fault.
- What'd I do?

951
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:31,313
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
Kuzco would be dead now!

952
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:36,110
There'll be no more diversions until
we track that llama down and kill him!

953
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,320
Said I was sorry. Can't just let it go.

954
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,322
Not even on your birthday.

955
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,575
Kuzco must be eliminated.

956
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,786
The empire will finally be
rid of that useless slug.

957
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,329
You got a point.

958
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,665
Nobody really seems to care
that he's gone, do they?

959
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,920
Pacha!

960
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,509
Pacha?

961
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,216
So this is where you came in.

962
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:43,219
See, just like I said, I'm the victim here.

963
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,221
I didn't do anything,
and they ruined my life

964
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,388
and took everything I had.

965
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,015
Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?

966
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,392
What? I'm just telling them
what happened.

967
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,894
Who you kidding, pal?

968
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,271
They saw the whole thing,
they know what happened.

969
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,106
Well, yeah, but...

970
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,900
Just leave me alone.

971
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,430
The peasant at the diner!

972
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,934
He didn't pay his check.

973
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,614
He's the peasant
who I saw leaving the city

974
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,993
who disappeared into the crowd
with Kuzco on the back of his cart.

975
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,494
He must have taken him
back to his village,

976
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:54,623
so if we find the village, we find him,
and if we find him, we find Kuzco.

977
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,668
Yeah, it's all comin' together.

978
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,879
- Yzma!
- What?

979
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,300
This had better be good!

980
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:14,495
So, there we were standing on the cliff,
and the ground started to rumble.

981
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:18,582
And just as it started to go,
he grabbed me before I fell.

982
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,709
Do you believe that?

983
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,754
You know, call me crazy for following
this guy all the way out here,

984
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,716
but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him.

985
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:31,011
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

986
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,180
He's a lousy llama.

987
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,809
I mean, a really lousy llama.

988
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,323
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know,

989
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:55,411
what I said to you back at the diner,
that, I didn't really...

990
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,790
So, you tired of being a llama?

991
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,585
Yes!

992
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,339
Okay, we're just gonna stop
at the house and get some supplies.

993
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,383
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

994
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,094
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

995
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,303
My relatives?

996
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,264
We just sent them up to your house.

997
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,432
What did they look like?

998
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:20,227
See, there was this big guy
and this older woman who was...

999
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,062
How would you describe her?

1000
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,564
Scary beyond all reason.

1001
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,023
Yeah, that's it.

1002
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,318
So, remind me again
how you're related to Pacha?

1003
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,614
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's
wife's step-niece's great-aunt.

1004
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,826
Twice removed.

1005
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,955
Isn't that right, Kronk?

1006
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,624
Ninety-nine monkeys
jumpin' on the bed

1007
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,502
One fell off and bumped his head

1008
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,755
You know, I am so sorry
that you had to come all this way,

1009
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,300
but as I said to you before,

1010
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,886
you may recall, Pacha is not here.

1011
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,138
I'll be sure and tell him you came by.

1012
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,641
Would you, please?
That would be just great.

1013
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,436
Silly me.

1014
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,771
No, no. Allow me.

1015
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,569
She's hiding something.

1016
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,488
When I give the word,
we search the house.

1017
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,656
Okay, but I still have 94 monkeys to go.

1018
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,994
So, while we're waiting for Paca...

1019
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,289
- Pacha.
- Yes.

1020
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,833
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

1021
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,253
You know, why don't you just come
back when Pacha gets home?

1022
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,381
I'm sure he'd love to show you the...

1023
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,717
Excuse me, won't you?

1024
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,677
I think I left something in the oven.

1025
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:40,307
This is my variation of double-dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.

1026
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,100
- Kronk, it's time!
- Okay!

1027
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,731
So, we have to get back to the palace,
find the lab, and change him back.

1028
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,024
Hi there!

1029
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,693
That was him.

1030
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:54,988
You know what?

1031
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,491
I don't believe
you're really my great-aunt.

1032
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,826
You're more like my great-great-great...

1033
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,621
Go. I'll stall them long enough
for you two to get a head start.

1034
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,039
Thanks, honey.

1035
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,000
You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.

1036
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,045
Great-great-great...

1037
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,881
All right! Are you through?

1038
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,883
- Great-great-aunt.
- So, where were we?

1039
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,510
Listen, sister, we're not leaving until...

1040
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,554
I show you the house. Of course.

1041
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,890
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

1042
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,351
Don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

1043
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,438
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.

1044
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,232
There is no handle in here.

1045
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,568
There's not? Are you sure?

1046
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,570
All right, I've had enough of this.

1047
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,073
Tell us where the talking llama is and
we'll burn your house to the ground.

1048
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,742
Don't you mean "or"?

1049
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:44,496
Tell us where the talking llama is
or we'll burn your house to the ground.

1050
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,581
Well, which is it?

1051
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,499
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

1052
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,794
That's it! Kronk, break the door down!

1053
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,922
Break it down? Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.

1054
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,091
I don't care, you fool. Get out of my way.

1055
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,176
I'll break it down myself.

1056
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,887
- A-one...
- Okay, kids, you know what to do.

1057
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,889
- Two...
- Right, Mom!

1058
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,474
Three!

1059
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:20,907
Okay, children, on your mark,
get set, go!

1060
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,453
Stop it, you little brats!

1061
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:31,126
There they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

1062
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,713
Well, I had a great time.

1063
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,008
Let's not wait until the next
family reunion to get together.

1064
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,217
Kronk!

1065
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,428
I gotta run.

1066
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,208
Okay, why does she even
have that lever?

1067
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,253
Please remain seated

1068
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,255
and keep your arms
and legs in at all times.

1069
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,266
- What does it look like?
- I don't know. Just keep looking.

1070
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,559
Over here!

1071
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:14,563
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

1072
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,732
Oh, my.

1073
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,650
Looking for this?

1074
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,654
No! It can't be!

1075
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,614
How did you get back here before us?

1076
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,909
How did we, Kronk?

1077
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:31,204
Well, you got me.
By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.

1078
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,957
Well, back to business.

1079
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,292
Okay, I admit it.

1080
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,043
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

1081
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,921
but, Yzma,
do you really want to kill me?

1082
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:43,258
Just think of it as you're being let go,

1083
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,594
that your life's going
in a different direction,

1084
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:49,306
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

1085
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,601
Hey, that's kind of like what he said
to you when you got fired.

1086
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:57,564
I know. It's called a cruel irony
like my dependence on you.

1087
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,274
I can't believe this is happening!

1088
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,443
Then I bet you weren't expecting this.

1089
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,570
No!

1090
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,281
Okay.

1091
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,617
Finish them off.

1092
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,330
Hey, you're not backing down now,
are you, big guy?

1093
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,333
Where's the other guy?

1094
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,252
Yo!

1095
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,213
Sorry I'm late. So, what'd I miss?

1096
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,964
Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife

1097
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,300
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

1098
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,094
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

1099
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,346
and quite honestly...

1100
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,390
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

1101
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,934
This one simple thing.

1102
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,435
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.

1103
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,603
Now.

1104
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,564
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

1105
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,900
And do you want to know
something else?

1106
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,985
I've never liked your spinach puffs.

1107
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,446
Never!

1108
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,367
That's it. She's going down.

1109
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,952
Now, now, remember, guys.

1110
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,205
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

1111
01:03:58,459 --> 01:03:59,709
That'll work.

1112
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,802
Strange. That usually works.

1113
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,262
And so does this!

1114
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,139
Should have seen that coming.

1115
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,727
Give me that vial!

1116
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,780
Clumsy me.

1117
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,242
Which one? Which one?

1118
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,831
Better hurry. I'm expecting company.

1119
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,879
Kill them! They murdered the emperor!

1120
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,841
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me... Kuzco!

1121
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,217
They're not listening to me!

1122
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,219
Just take 'em all!

1123
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,103
Get them!

1124
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:03,315
Hey, I've been turned into a cow.
Can I go home?

1125
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,859
You're excused. Anyone else?

1126
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,360
No, we're good.

1127
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,737
Get them!

1128
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,489
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

1129
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,036
Pacha? A little help!

1130
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,123
Come on! Come on!

1131
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,716
Please be something with wings.

1132
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,055
Yeah! We're flyin'!

1133
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,688
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.

1134
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,649
- I'm picking the next one!
- Fine by me!

1135
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,858
Give me that one!

1136
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,612
Don't you say a word.

1137
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,494
Quick! Drain the canals!

1138
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,288
Open up!

1139
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,086
I'm a llama again!

1140
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,295
Wait...

1141
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,973
There they go! After them!

1142
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,476
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

1143
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,163
Okay, only two left.
It's gotta be one of these.

1144
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,378
No!

1145
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:00,932
I'll take that.

1146
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,476
This is the one.
This'll change you back to a human.

1147
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,605
Hey, get her off!

1148
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,733
Get her off me!

1149
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,784
Drink the potion!

1150
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,411
Okay, okay.

1151
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,038
Where did it go? Where is it?

1152
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,582
Looking for this?

1153
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:29,127
Is that my voice? Is that my voice?

1154
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,087
Well.

1155
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,547
No! Don't drop it!

1156
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,008
I'm not going to drop it, you fool!

1157
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,052
I'm going to drink it!

1158
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,888
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self,

1159
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,557
I'm going to kill you!

1160
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:17,008
Kuzco!

1161
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,551
Be right there! Give me a minute!

1162
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:22,472
Kuzco!

1163
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,392
Kuzco!

1164
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,442
The vial!

1165
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:46,371
For the last time,
we did not order a giant trampoline.

1166
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,916
You know, pal, you could have told me
that before I set it up.

1167
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,724
The vial!

1168
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,893
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

1169
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,080
I win.

1170
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,751
Got it!

1171
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,754
What are the odds of that
trapdoor leading me out here?

1172
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,508
Yeah!

1173
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,890
Here, let me get this for you.

1174
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,437
Well, see ya on the other side.

1175
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,950
Now, you stop being so hard
on yourself. All is forgiven.

1176
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,243
You're sure?

1177
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,829
It's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,

1178
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,539
and it won't be the last.

1179
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,625
What can I say? I'm a rebel.

1180
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,418
Tiger.

1181
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,128
Hey, I got to use that arm later.

1182
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,922
Okay, buddy, take care.

1183
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:21,758
He's a sweet guy.

1184
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,728
So, you lied to me.

1185
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,440
- I did?
- Yeah.

1186
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:41,069
You said when the sun hits this ridge
just right, these hills sing.

1187
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:43,321
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills,

1188
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,448
and I did not hear any singing.

1189
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,036
So...

1190
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,916
I'll be building my summer home
on a more magical hill. Thank you.

1191
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,380
Couldn't pull the wool over your eyes?

1192
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,423
No, no, I'm sharp, I'm on it.

1193
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,633
Looks like you and your family

1194
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:06,010
are stuck on that tuneless
hilltop forever, pal.

1195
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:19,023
You know, I'm pretty sure I heard
some singing on the hill next to us.

1196
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,526
In case you're interested.

1197
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:28,241
Boom, baby!

1198
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:30,618
Boom, baby!

1199
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,582
You'd be the coolest dude
In the nation

1200
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,710
Or the hippest cat in creation

1201
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:42,130
But if you ain't got friends
then nothing's worth the fuss

1202
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,758
A perfect world will come to be

1203
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,844
When everybody here can see

1204
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:50,221
That a perfect world begins and ends

1205
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,515
A perfect world begins and ends

1206
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:55,351
A perfect world begins
and ends with us

1207
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,604
"My acorn is missing. "

1208
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,565
Squeak squeakin' squeak squeakity.

1209
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,191
"Did you eat the acorn?"

1210
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,319
Squeaker squeak squeak squeakin'?

1211
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,237
"You owe me a new acorn. "

1212
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,531
Squeak squeak squeak squeak
squeaker...

1213
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:11,784
Squeakin'.

1214
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,286
I'm so proud of you guys.
